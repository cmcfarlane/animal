Introduction

xvi-ii:  "Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss wrote that animals are 'good to think,' but my book's premise is that it is good to 'unthink' animals and so to rethink our conclusions about who we are, who they are, and how we all are intertwined."

xvii:  "in modernism, we know (or believe we can determine) who is acting, who is acted upon, what is right, what is wrong, and who consequently is to be condemned for the wrong actions. Postmodernist works, in their enthusiastic disruption of identities and breaking down of boundaries, often seem to give up the ethical to an anarchic thrill."

xx:  "theory's turn to animals grows out of, on the one hand, a weariness with post-structuralism's linguistic turn and a resulting search for a postlinguistic and perhaps posthuman sublime and, on the other hand, an often conflicting turn to ethics that raises the question of our human responsibility to the animal-other."

xxii:  "the difficulties we have in doing right by animals and in thinking ethically about what is our most common animal practice--killing them."

xxiii:  "Francione represents an extreme position in animal ethics and politics that can be described as authorizing the sacrifice of all domestic animals in the name of delivering humans from the crimes of sacrifice--crimes committed daily around the world.

xxiv:  "we are not and have never been the sole authors of a history that is always intertwined with the animals we feed and feed off of."

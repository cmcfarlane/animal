Introduction
---

xvi-ii:  "Claude Lévi-Strauss wrote that animals are 'good to think,' but my book's premise is that it is good to 'unthink' animals and so to rethink our conclusions about who we are, who they are, and how we all are intertwined."

xvii:  "in modernism, we know (or believe we can determine) who is acting, who is acted upon, what is right, what is wrong, and who consequently is to be condemned for the wrong actions. Postmodernist works, in their enthusiastic disruption of identities and breaking down of boundaries, often seem to give up the ethical to an anarchic thrill."

xx:  "theory's turn to animals grows out of, on the one hand, a weariness with post-structuralism's linguistic turn and a resulting search for a postlinguistic and perhaps posthuman sublime and, on the other hand, an often conflicting turn to ethics that raises the question of our human responsibility to the animal-other."

xxii:  "the difficulties we have in doing right by animals and in thinking ethically about what is our most common animal practice--killing them."

xxiii:  "Francione represents an extreme position in animal ethics and politics that can be described as authorizing the sacrifice of all domestic animals in the name of delivering humans from the crimes of sacrifice--crimes committed daily around the world.

xxiv:  "we are not and have never been the sole authors of a history that is always intertwined with the animals we feed and feed off of."

Chapter 1: A Report on the Animal Turn
---

4:  "Unlike in women's studies or ethnic studies, however, those who constitute the object of animal studies cannot speak for themselves, or at least they cannot speak any of the languages that the academy recognizes as necessary for such self-representation. Must they then be forever condemned to the status of objects?"

5:  "one might ask how the notion of 'animal rights' might similarly entrench animals under a falsely unifying idea of 'the animal'?"

5:  "If animal studies has come of age, it is perhaps because nonhuman animals have become a limit case for theories of difference, otherness, and power."

7:  "On the one hand are those who look to our nonhuman others with envy or admiration precisely because they remain outside language and thus suggest the possibility of unmediated experience. On the other are those who would prove that animals do indeed speak and can tell us, however imperfectly, of their lives and their traumas."

11:  "the problem of language is less one of imitation than of translation."

11:  We may know animals in ways they cannot--we may know their breeds, their color, their weight, their names, their 'histories'--but they may also know us in aways that we cannot know because they know the world and us by other means."

15:  "Deleuze and Guattari want to free humans and animals from meaning altogether and thus to undo the very identities that confirm a distinction between human and animal."

16:  "With Agamben, as with Deleuze and Guattari, theory's concern for the animal moved quite a distance from questions of rights or even protection for animals."

16:  "has, indeed, little to say about the actual animals we live with."

17:  "This is an area that has brought animal and trauma studies together: we can recognize the serious harms rendered to victims of horrific acts, but we cannot count on those victims to tell us their stories or what to do about them."

20:  "With this in mind [Bennett's critical empathy], we might then want to call an ethical relating to animals (whether in theory or in art) 'critical anthropomorphism' in the sense that we open ourselves to touch and to be touched by others as fellow subjects and may imagine their pain, pleasure, and need in anthropomorphic terms, but stop short of believing that we can know their experience."

20:  "critical anthropomorphism must begin with the acknowledgment that the irreducible difference that animals may present for us is one that is also within us and within the term *human*."

22:  "The ethical, like the animal, is a category of the human."

Chapter 2: Seeing Animals
---

26:  "the representation of various nonhuman animals poses the question of how they might be seen on their own terms rather than seen as fitting into categories imposed upon them by humans."

45:  "Although anthropomorphism was a common practice in earlier times, under the Enlightenment any attribution of our own capacities or characteristics to animals was seen to conflict with the scientific and rational capacities that made us human."

Chapter 3: Is a Pet an Animal? Domestication and Animal Agency
---

55:  Discussing Tuan: "As products of and subjects to the abuse of power, pets are potential victims, but their status, like the status of human-pet relations more generally, is rendered ambiguous because of the care and 'humaneness' with which they may be bred, trained, and fed and because of the simultaneously abusive and productive ways power operates in the aesthetic-cultural realm."

57:  "agency has become a problematic topic within animal studies because a notion of nonhuman agency carries the charge of anthropomorphism."

60:  "Some theories are bent on proving humans' inhumanity toward animals, but in so doing they disregard or dismiss animals' humanlike qualities. Other theories focus precisely on the unseen or unacknowledged capabilities that pets share with humans in an effort to redeem practices that rely on those qualities, if not exploit them. […] the alternative of seeing dogs and cats and horses only as products of indefensible human dominion is also ideological."

Chapter 4: Gendered Subjects/Abject Objects: Man(n)'s Best Friend
---

71:  "manhood is sought through the joint sacrifice of women and animals."

Chapter 5: Dog Love/Wo(o)lf Love
---

81:  "'dog love' […] is paradoxically a bond that frees not only because of the perspective it offers on domesticity and the roles to which dog and mistress are confined, but also because it reveals, even as it acts to change the patriarchal foundations that link domestic or private and public worlds."

83:  "The importance of acknowledging anthropomorphism and, for that matter, zoomorphism as strategies is to underscore not only the degree of invention involved in writing any life, but also and more important the limitations of the *Umwelt* or world in which our writing takes place and that we may not be able to escape other than by refuting our own situatedness within history."

96:  "Dog love, we might say, is polymorphously productive rather than polymorphously perverse and, as such, a force for a more just and contented civilization."

Chapter 6: A Proper Death
---

101:  "What, indeed, is a proper death for a dog or a human, and what, if anything, determines what are 'proper' rituals of grief and mourning?"

102:  "*Guardian*, as I explained earlier, has become the preferred term for those who have have and care for pets, but because horses are considered livestock rather than pets, it is really ownership (and money) that can make a difference in terms of how they die and what happens after their death."

103:  "*Ownership* may  be the legal term with which we describe such relations, but on an emotional level the term does not describe such mutual dependence."

112:  Quoting British Animal Studies Group: "Almost all areas of human life are at some point or other involved in or directly dependent on the killing of animals […]. This killing is ubiquitous and omnipresent… largely invisible in the public domain."

Chapter 7: Thinking and Unthinking Animal Death: Temple Grandin and J.M. Coetzee
---

116:  "To prioritize our subjective (and messy) interdependence, according to much of current theory and literature, entails a stripping of autonomous selfhood or at least an undoing of those capacities for rational thinking, language, and agency that are said to determine ethical laws."

120:  "(1) human consciousness is an obstacle to a knowledge we may have once possessed--a larger, less circumscribed, and less rational way of knowing--and (2) it may be possible if not to retrieve, then to imagine a fullness of vision in poetry or through the eyes of those who are removed from 'normal' sociolinguistic and cognitive disabilities."

124:  "My point here is not to find fault with Grandin, who has done much to improve the handling of cattle, but to draw attention to the scene's contradictory and competing interests."

Introduction

1-2:  "The thesis of this book is that the practice of capturing and oppressing cows, sheep, pigs, horses, goats, and similar large, sociable animals for human use did not, as Shaler put it, 'set *men* well upon their upward way.' Rather, it *undermined* the development of a just and peaceful world. The harms that humans have done to other animals---*especially that harm generated by pastoralist and ranching practices that have culminated in contemporary factory-farming practices*---have been a precondition for and have engendered large-scale violence against and injury to devalued humans, particularly indigenous people around the world."

4:  "This book's perspective also is distinct from popular opinion and mainstream scholarship in presenting most human use of other animals, past and present, as *violence*---as the unethical and chauvinistic treatment of the other inhabitants of the planet."

4-5:  "This book is a comparative historical analysis that examines recurring patterns of the oppression of significant numbers of large animals for food and resources by elites in different societies and at different points in history and discusses how this form of oppression led to invasion, conquest, and other harms. While the historical periods and regions are unique, they are not beyond comparison. The focal point of this study is the process commonly referred to as animal 'domestication' and how this practice caused large-scae violence, destruction, and disease epidemics. Specifically, it will compare the ways that such use of other animals in different societies---as instruments of warfare, forced laborers, or rations and other resources---has *enabled* widespread violence. This work also will review the ways in which such use of other animals has *promoted* harm. These include damage from the need to expropriate the land and water necessary to maintain large groups of animals, the amassing of military power resulting from animal exploitation, and the pursuit of economic benefit from the use or sale of animals. The widespread violence and destruction engendered by such uses of large numbers of 'domesticated' animals encompasses both the violence experienced by the animals and the ways in which this harm has been entangled with related forms of violence against free-living animals and groups of devaued humans. These include invasion, conquest, extermination, displacement, repression, coerced and enslaved servitude, gender subordination and sexual exploitation, and hunger. Accompanying such violence have been deadly zoonotic diseases that have contributed to the destruction of entire cities, societies, and civilizations. Finally, as the practice of oppression and the impediments to effective moral challenges to the practice are closely tied to the material interests of elites, special attention will be given to the relationship between animal 'domestication' and the development and expansion of the capitalist system. A primary assumption of this work is that oppression---of both humans and other animals---is entangled with and motivated by the desire for material gain, especially by elites. Morever, for instationalized oppression to occur, it must be supported by state power and justified through ideological manipulation."

10:  "For most of our time on the earth, the members of the human species lived relatively peaceably and survived by sharing resources obtained by foraging and gathering."

10:  "This early form of communal, egalitarian human society was undermined by the onset of organized hunting of other animals, which began no earlier than ninety thousand years ago---and probably much later. The practice of stalking and killing animals increased the propensity for violence among human hunters, and the status of men in society began to be associated largely with their skill and success at hunting other animals. At the same time, the status of women declined; they came to perform more of the daily tasks and child care, while cultivated their skill at stalking animals." 

12:  "*Domesecration* is the systemic practice of violence in which social animals are enslaved and biologically manipulated, resulting in their objectification, subordination, and oppression."

14:  "While the enslavement of large groups of domesecrated animals necessitated migration and invasion, there was another motivation for conquest: settled, plant-based societies had manufactured and luxury goods that nomadic groups could not produce."

34:  "With domesecration and enslavement of large mammals being a primary factory in much of the widespread, large-scale violence in Eurasia, it might be expected that there would be less violence in a region of the world that did not have populations of large, domesecrated animals: the pre-Columbian Americas."

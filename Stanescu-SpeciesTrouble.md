568:  "To tear up, or to have trouble functioning, to feel that moment of utter suffocation of being in a hall of death is something rendered completely socially unintelligible. Most people's response is that we need therapy, or that we can't be sincere."

568:  "most of us, even those of us who are absolutely committed to fighting for animals, regularly have to engage in disavowal."

568:  "Mourning is always a political act. [...] questions over who gets to mourn, and who is mournable, is at the heart of the political, at the heart of social intelligibility."

569:  "Indeed, the philosophical and scientific questions we use all involve some formulation of 'What makes us human?' rather than 'What makes us another animal?'" Hence, we spend a lot of time separating/individuating ourselves rather than looking at the commonality of living things.

570:  "This human exceptionalism comes from a fear and shame that we are, in fact, nothing but animals."

571:  "Butler's philosophy necessitates anti-anthropomorphism if it is to make sense."

572:  "[Butler's] position that animal life and human life are impossible to firmly distinguish. However, this claim is based upon an even more profound claim: that animals have a type of life particular to *bios*."

574:  "for Butler, precariousness is not a condition to be overcome or critique, in the way that bare life would be for Agamben. Rather, precariousness becomes a place from which to think and organize."

575:  "Precariousness is a place for thinking the ethical because it begins with the Other, rather than with the self. To apprehend the Other's life as a precarious life is not, however, merely an ethical proposition."

575:  "Precariousness is also, at the same time, an ontological proposition, a particular kind of ontology"

575:  "By turning our ontological lenses to precariousness, we begin the process of reconceiving ontology in its properly anti-anthropocentric character."

575-6:  "it is not our precarious lives we have to worry about, but instead our systems of immunity against our vulnerability that are our biggest threat. THus, we have wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to protect us; we have nuclear weapons to protect us; we have the Patriot Act to protect us; we lock up millions of people in the United States to protect us; and on and on. Immunity is always a function of disavowal"

578:  "It is our very ability to be wounded, our very dependency, that brings us together."

579:  "Those of us who mourn animals, those of us who mourn the animals at the butcher counter at the beginning of this article, face a double burden. Not only is the mourning of animals something completely disavowed, but those animals we mourn are so often anonymous animals."

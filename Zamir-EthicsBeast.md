3:  "my contention in this book is that allowing the speciesist/nonspeciesist opposition to govern the call to rethink the moral status of animals is significantly misleading, unnecessary, and detrimental to this important cause."

4:  liberationists/liberationism: "A. The belief that nonhuman animals are systematically expelled from the pale of substantial moral consideration either by objectification or by downplaying the manner by which moral concerns ought to inform our animal-related conduct. B. The sense that numerous animal-related practices ought to be substantially reformed or eliminated. C. An undertaking of a transformation in one's own personal conduct in relation to animal-related practices. For example, boycotting some commodities, or modifying one's diet, clothing, footwear, or choice of cosmetics (all or some of these are sufficient for C)."

5:  "The mere identification of species membership as a morally relevant property should not bother liberationists."

5:  "Similarly, a mere assertion of human superiority should not, on its own, bother liberationists."

Nibert, David. *Animal Rights/Human Rights: Entanglements of Oppression and Liberation*. Rowman & Littlefield, 2002.
===

Book attempts an intersection analysis of the oppression of humans and non-human animals. Analytically and theoretically it is rather simple. Analytically, it largely depends on already available research. Theoretically it expounds a crass Marxism---although Nibert goes out of his way to say this Marxism is a not a "vulgar Marxism"---that treats individuals as cultural dupes, the state as mere means of the economy, and an odd belief in the spontaneous goodness of the workers that has been purposefully corrupted by culture, state and, of course, economy. Methodologically it is based upon coincidence and asserted correlations. There is little to no attempt to provide any sort of demonstration of causality or even that examples are anything but fortuitous and coincidental. 

Introduction
---

xiii:  "In myriad ways the oppression of other animals has been devastating for the cultural, spiritual, and economic well-being of the vast majority of humans."

xiii:  "The ideological entanglements between exploitation of humans and other animals are fueled by, and intertwined with, economic-based oppression---particularly under corporate capitalism."

Chapter 1: Toward a Sociological Analysis of Animal Oppression
---

3:  "The exploitation of other animals and the justification of their mistreatment not only closely resemble human oppression but are inextricably tied to it."

3:  "the historical oppression of humans and other animals has provided a benefit primarily for a relatively *small* number of humans, particularly those with substantial privilege and power.""

3:  "The mistreatment of devalued humans and other animals has been, and continues to be, driven largely (although not exclusively) by individual material interests and the broader economic systems that condition them---not by biology or innate prejudice."

4:  "oppressive treatment of groups of humans is not natural or inevitable; rather, it is part of a tightly woven set of cultural practies that are deeply established in social arrangements. *Moreoever, the oppression of various devalued groups in human societies is not independent and unrelated; rather, the arrangements that lead to various forms of oppression are integrated in such a way that the exploitation of one group frequently augments and compounds the mistreatment of others*."

6-7:  "*An oppressed group shares physical, cultural, or economic characteristics and is subjected for the economic, political, and social gain of a privileged group, to a social system that institutionalizes its exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, deprivation, or vulnerability to violence*."

8:  "Most sociologists consider racism, as well as sexism, classism, and other 'isms' to be ideologies. That is, they are neither prejudice nor mistreatment. Rather, an *ideology* is *a set of socially shared beliefs that legitimates an existing or desired social order*."

12:  "First, humans compete with other animals for economic resources, including the use of land. Second, exploitation of other animals serves numerous economic ends for human animals, providing sources of food, power, clothing, furniture, entertainment, and resarch tools."

13:  "This theory also points to the importance of power. One important aspect of power is the ability of one group to exert its will against another, regardless of resistance. [â€¦] The most concentrated form of power for the most of the past ten thousand years has been the *state*."

13:  "Finally, ideological conditioning is the third essential requirement for oppressive social arrangements. Oppression requires rationalization and legitimation; that is, it must appear as the right thing to do, both to the oppressing group and in the eyes of others. A set of ideas that devalues an entire group---an ideology, such as racism, sexism, or speciesism---thus is socially constructed. That ideology provides explanation and support for the development and perpetuation of social institutions that are deeply rooted in the elimination or exploitation of the oppressed group. Moreover, the ideology justifying that action is promulgated throughout the social system in order to garner public acceptance and reduce dissent. Over time, these socially constructed ideas will come to be accepted as real and true, and the 'lower' or 'special' position of the oppressed group will be viewed as the natural order of things, promoting ethnocentrism and anthropocentrism."

13:  Cites three factors "for the development and perpetuation of oppression": (1) "economic exploitation/competition", (2) "unequal power, largely vested in control of the state", (3) "ideological control".

13:  "Generally speaking, then, humans tend to disperse, eliminate, or exploit a group they percieve to be unlike themselves (an outgroup or the 'other') when it is in their economic interests to do so. Next, the oppressing group must have the power to subordinate members of the at-risk group. While physical force is the key to this subordination, such force is usually vested in part in political control. Those who exercise political control wield the power of the state, with the ability to make and enforce law. Finally, ideological manipulation fuels prejudiced attitudes and discriminatory acts that help protect and maintain oppressive economic and social arrangements. Such arrangements are made to appear natural, thus making the oppression invisible to those who enjoy privilege and who gain some benefit from such oppression."

14:  "In the case of the theory of oppression, for example, since ideological devaluation and uses of unequal power are prompted largely by material circumstances, they can be reduced---creating possibilities for increased tolerance---when oppression of a devalued group no longer serves the interest of the oppressors."

Chapter 2: Economic Basis of Animal Oppression
---

23:  "Culture is composed of common beliefs, values, language, customs, and norms; social structure refers to the ways humans are organized to coordinate actions and work toward established goals. Since human animals, interacting with one another, invent culture and social structure, we say these things are *socially created*."

Generally a potted history: hunter-gatherer, agriculture, state, modern capitalism, all of which are seen as gradually expanding the domination over animals and women. While writing a history of human/animal relations that is attentive to how this feeds back into human/human relations is incredibly complex and difficult (there is not yet one single book that does this well with large-scale historical scope), this chapter does not add much. It is largely marxism (fairly vulgar) added to some anthropology and adding in some animals.

Chapter 3: Capitalist Expansion and Oppression
---

69:  "The speciesist sense of pride in walking down the street with a purebred dog was not dissimilar to a man's sexist enjoyment of being seen with an attractive woman or a woman's classist satisfaction in walking out with a rich man."

Chapter 4: The Growth of Agribusiness and Global Oppression
---

105:  "At least 70 percent of the grain produced in Western industrialized countries is sold as feed for 'farm animals,' as is more than  70 percent of the grain grown in the United States."

113: "Perhaps no corporation is more savvy at killing millions of other animals and exploiting devalued humans than Smithfield Foods."

113:  "Today it is estimated that at least 25 percent of the 'meatpacking' workers in the Midwest alone are illegal."

Chapter 5: Oppression and the Capitalist State
---

150:  "Austin Turk outlined five kinds of power that law can give to those who control it: physical force, economic control, political control, ideological power, and diversionary power. While each type of power can be isolated for theoretical reflection, in reality they are usually tightly woven together and are, as such, mutually reinforcing."

160:  "How are 'rights' for other animals to be obtained within a system that is constructed to guard against the imposition of such rights?"

Chapter 6: The Social Construction of Speciesist Reality
---

196:  "The conflict between most people's urges toward decency and a social system rooted in oppression leads to the widespread ambivalence about various oppressed 'others.'"

197:  "Invidious ideologies (classism, racism, sexism, speciesism, etc.) are manufactured by the powerful to legitimate their wealth--and these ideologies spawn individual prejudice."

Chapter 7: Toward a United Struggle Against Oppression 
---

243:  "a view that ignores the possibilities that socialism may offer for liberation of other animals unduly limits visions and strategies for political alliances and social change."

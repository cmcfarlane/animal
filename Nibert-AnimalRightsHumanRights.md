Introduction

xiii:  "In myriad ways the oppression of other animals has been devastating for the cultural, spiritual, and economic well-being of the vast majority of humans."

xiii:  "The ideological entanglements between exploitation of humans and other animals are fueled by, and intertwined with, economic-based oppression---particularly under corporate capitalism."

3:  "The exploitation of other animals and the justification of their mistreatment not only closely resemble human oppression but are inextricably tied to it."

3:  "the historical oppression of humans and other animals has provided a benefit primarily for a relatively *small* number of humans, particularly those with substantial privilege and power.""

3:  "The mistreatment of devalued humans and other animals has been, and continues to be, driven largely (although not exclusively) by individual material interests and the broader economic systems that condition them---not by biology or innate prejudice."

4:  "oppressive treatment of groups of humans is not natural or inevitable; rather, it is part of a tightly woven set of cultural practies that are deeply established in social arrangements. *Moreoever, the oppression of various devalued groups in human societies is not independent and unrelated; rather, the arrangements that lead to various forms of oppression are integrated in such a way that the exploitation of one group frequently augments and compounds the mistreatment of others*."

6-7:  "*An oppressed group shares physical, cultural, or economic characteristics and is subjected for the economic, political, and social gain of a privileged group, to a social system that institutionalizes its exploitation, marginalization, powerlessness, deprivation, or vulnerability to violence*."

8:  "Most sociologists consider racism, as well as sexism, classism, and other 'isms' to be ideologies. That is, they are neither prejudice nor mistreatment. Rather, an *ideology* is *a set of socially shared beliefs that legitimates an existing or desired social order*."

12:  "First, humans compete with other animals for economic resources, including the use of land. Second, exploitation of other animals serves numerous economic ends for human animals, providing sources of food, power, clothing, furniture, entertainment, and resarch tools."

13:  "This theory also points to the importance of power. One important aspect of power is the ability of one group to exert its will against another, regardless of resistance. [â€¦] The most concentrated form of power for the most of the past ten thousand years has been the *state*."

13:  "Finally, ideological conditioning is the third essential requirement for oppressive social arrangements. Oppression requires rationalization and legitimation; that is, it must appear as the right thing to do, both to the oppressing group and in the eyes of others. A set of ideas that devalues an entire group---an ideology, such as racism, sexism, or speciesism---thus is socially constructed. That ideology provides explanation and support for the development and perpetuation of social institutions that are deeply rooted in the elimination or exploitation of the oppressed group. Moreover, the ideology justifying that action is promulgated throughout the social system in order to garner public acceptance and reduce dissent. Over time, these socially constructed ideas will come to be accepted as real and true, and the 'lower' or 'special' position of the oppressed group will be viewed as the natural order of things, promoting ethnocentrism and anthropocentrism."

13:  Cites three factors "for the development and perpetuation of oppression": (1) "economic exploitation/competition", (2) "unequal power, largely vested in control of the state", (3) "ideological control".

13:  "Generally speaking, then, humans tend to disperse, eliminate, or exploit a group they percieve to be unlike themselves (an outgroup or the 'other') when it is in their economic interests to do so. Next, the oppressing group must have the power to subordinate members of the at-risk group. While physical force is the key to this subordination, such force is usually vested in part in political control. Those who exercise political control wield the power of the state, with the ability to make and enforce law. Finally, ideological manipulation fuels prejudiced attitudes and discriminatory acts that help protect and maintain oppressive economic and social arrangements. Such arrangements are made to appear natural, thus making the oppression invisible to those who enjoy privilege and who gain some benefit from such oppression."

14:  "In the case of the theory of oppression, for example, since ideological devaluation and uses of unequal power are prompted largely by material circumstances, they can be reduced---creating possibilities for increased tolerance---when oppression of a devalued group no longer serves the interest of the oppressors."

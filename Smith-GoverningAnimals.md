Introduction

xii:  "Ethicists typically focus on the moral duties we have as private individuals rather than the political duties we have as citizens. But my question concerns *political* obligations. Specifically, I'm concerned with whether and how the sate, and more specifically the liberal state, can defend animal welfare."

xiii:  "It [liberal political theory] is generally characterized by (1) an assumption of human equality and (2) a concern with preserving human liberty, usually (but not always) conceptualized as preserving individual rights from government power. Unfortunately, its focus on human liberty and human equality means that liberal political theory has been remarkably unhelpful on animal governance."

xiii:  "I take up three key liberal concepts--the social contract, property rights, and representation--and explore how they should be understood when applied to animals."

xiii:  "Liberalism may not take us as far as the more radical defenders of animal rights would like, but it does, I believe, support broader protections for animal welfare than any nation currently provides."

xiv:  "Animals (a term I will use to encompass not only mammals but also birds, fish, reptiles, and insects) are too deeply involved in the political sphere--as subjects of regulation, members of families and communities, and even workers--to be treated as mere undifferentiated, nonsentient, inanimate things. They are best understood as neither human persons nor mere things but *fellow creatures*, co-inhabitants of our ecological and social spaces."

xiv:  "our liberal theory can be based on a broad *social* consensus about the status of animals."

xiv:  "The liberalism on offer here depends on an overlapping consensus [â€¦] that some animals are members of the social contract. A liberal state that enjoys such a consensus has a sufficient social foundation for animal welfare policy, even if citizens disagree about the metaphysical principles supporting it."

xvii:  Potential objects to the project as stated and its assumptions might include: "that liberal political theory is primarily concerned with justice, and animals cannot be subjects of justice; that our relationship to animals isn't, properly speaking, 'political'; that improving our ethical relationships with animals isn't a liberal value; or that our relationships with animals are too unequal for liberal political theory to apply."

xvii:  "The animal welfare movement has been remarkably successful in making appeals to compassion, while the animal rights movement, when it appeals solely to our sense of justice, meets considerably more resistance."

xxiii:  "Our question is whether we can protect animal welfare and promote enriching animal/human relations in a way that serves--or at least does not undermine--what we value in human liberty."

	But, to be clear, the approach defended here maintains the priority of human interests over non-human interests even if there are no good reasons to maintain this priority?

xxiii:  "Most animal rights advocates emphasize similarities between human and nonhuman animals (sentience, reasoning, emotional life, and so on), and these similarities become the grounds for arguing for similar treatment under law and policy (like granting them rights). But that approach often leads animal rights activists to compare animal and human suffering, which in turn seems (to some) to trivialize human suffering. Should factory farms be compared to the Holocaust, and zoos to prison camps?"

xxv:  "The property status of animals does need some reform, but it is mass commerce in animals, result in their commodification, that deserves our concern."

	Doesn't this say, in effect, that the problem with animals isn't that they are commodities; the problem with animals is that they are commodities. This doesn't make sense.

	Like Cochrane, Smith bases her argument on Raz's version of liberalism. However, it appears as though they come to significantly and importantly different conclusions.

3:  "[the Endangered Species Act] codified a new ethical consensus that nonhumans can enjoy rights, or at least moral status."

	Citing Roderick Nash, *The Rights of Nature*, University of Wisconsin Press, 1989.

4:  "The development of our animal welfare laws has less to do with the expansion of our 'sphere of moral concern' than with the expansion of the liberal welfare state."

9:  Discussing Francione: "If standing doctrine prevents animal welfare organizations from brining suit on behalf of animals, and animals themselves cannot be named as plaintiffs, then in many cases no one is in a good position to ensure aggressive enforcement of these statutes."

11:  "Rather than affording legal protection to one's general, impersonal sympathy with or sense of justice toward animals, standing doctrine protects *social relationships between humans and animals*. And although the court is interested in the value of these relationships to humans, it is not implausible that this recognition could also be the basis for finding that some animals, at least, are legal 'persons': They are persons to us because we relate to them as members of our social community."

13:  "For ethical extension to work as social theory, it seems that something like the state or economic system must determine the bounds of the community and, accordingly, our ethical sentiments."

13-4:  "What *drives* ethical extension? Does the state play a role in expanding the moral community, or does public policy simply follow changing public sentiment? Should we look to other large-scale social forces, like the economy, to explain this extension, or focus our attention on the individual level, asking why and how a human is moved to recognize obligations to nonhumans?"

17: "we can identify four principal [sic] trends, from the late eighteenth through the twentieth centuries, that shaped the relationship of animals to the emerging American liberal welfare State and how we understand our ethical duties toward them: (1) the institutionalization (in animal welfare organizations, traditions of pet-keeping, and other practices) of a strong social ethic of kindness to animals; (2) the political organization of those with recreational interests in animals (particularly hunters, but also bird-watchers and outdoor enthusiasts), and the development of industries around those interests (such as gun manufacturing and tourism); (3) the increasing commodification and industrial production of animals (as markets for animal products and pets expanded); and (4) the expansion of the State's capacity to manage animals, principally in pursuit of military, economic, and public health objectives."

22-3:  "Thus some of the State and social capacity to manage a large slave population is probably due to the Euroamerican settlers' experience with livestock management."

23:  "More insidiously, this early concern with livestock breeds and patriotism foreshadows the later American obsession with racial purity (leading to miscegenation laws) and the early twentieth-century eugenics movements, both of which are also relevant to the racialization of the American State."

25:  "the commodification of pet animals did not depend on or create a strong regime of property rights."

26:  "In short, the animal welfare movement was an integral part of the development of the American welfare State, supported by a civil society pursuing a comprehensive ideal of humane behavior."

27:  "historically speaking, receiving legal rights is not always the straightest path to receiving greater welfare protections."

28:  "In some ways, the animal welfare movement has served to promote the more effective industrial exploitation of animals."

37:  "It is not clear that liberal governments have the right to use public resources to promote the welfare of nonhumans for their own sake. Under traditional liberal theory, the government's job is limited to promoting *human* welfare."

38:  "It is one thing to accomodate private relationships with pets; it is quite another to punish a citizen for failing to satisfy the government's view of how pets should be treated."

40:  "Why, then, do government actors insist on citing *human* interets in animal welfare?"

40:  "The difficulty faced by legislators and judges confronting animal cruelty is this: Cruelty towards animals may be morally repugnant, but it doesn't follow that the state has authority to prevent it."

40:  "If the purpose of government is to protect *human* welfare and freedom, on what grounds does the government restrict our freedom to treat animals any way we please?"

	It could very well be the case that under liberalism, this is the purpose of government. But, if liberalism is not able to include non-humans in its political theory and it is a clear ethical imperative that it does, then either liberalism has a faulty concept of government, or it has a faulty concept of the scope of government, or liberalism as such is incorrect.
	
41:  "My answer--the only answer, I suggest, that makes sense in light of the liberal tradition and the practices of modern liberal communities--is that some animals are in fact members of the community that the government is bound to protect. In other words, they are members of the liberal 'social contract.'"

41:  "If animal welfare laws aren't justified in liberal theory, that is not a problem for the animals; it is  problem for liberal theory."

45:  "Social contract theory holds that governments are created by the consent of the people as part of a (usually implicit) social contract among citizens."

47:  "The question here is whether our obligations toward animals are *public* duties, responsibilities carried not only by private individuals but also by the government and ourselves in our role as citizens."

48:  "Social contract theory is helpful to us because it focuses our attention on critical questions with regard to animals: Which animals are members of the social and political community? How do the rules and institutions we use to govern them affect their welfare? And, most important, what do our rules and institutions look like from the animal's point of view?"

48:  "If you have significant social relations with other member of the community, you're a member."

49:  "Viewing (some) animals as members of the social contract is consistent with and makes sense of most of our laws, our widespread social practices, our typical ways of talking about animals in public discourse, and well-documented measures of public opinion."

49:  "Welfare, and particularly the welfare of animals, can be understood fairly narrowly: taking care of animals' health, preventing undue suffering, and attending to their needs for sociality."

	Notes that most major texts of contemporary social contract theory exclude animals as a matter of course. Cites Rawls, *Political Liberalism*, 18 as excluding animals; Scanlon, *What We Owe to Ourselves*, 110, 129, 180-1 as excluding animals other than pets; but Rowlands,  *Animal Rights*, is contractarian, as is Matthew Talbert, "Contractualism and Our Duties to Nonhuman Animals," *Environmental Ethics 28 (2006): 201-15. Others include Donald Vandeveer, "Of Beasts, Person, and the Original Positin," *Monist* 62 (1979): 368-77; Michael Pritchard and Wade Robison, "Justice and the Treatment of Animals: A Critique of Rawls," *Environmental Ethics* 3 (1981): 55-61; Robert Elliot, "Rawlsian Justice and Non-Human Animals," *Journal of Applied Philosophy* 1 (1984): 95-106; and Brent Singer, "An Extension of Rawls's Theory of Justice to Environmental Ethics," *Environmental Ethics* 10 (1988): 217-31.

51:  "The problematic assumption here is that sole purpose of the social contract is to protect individual human autonomy."

Introduction

xii:  "Ethicists typically focus on the moral duties we have as private individuals rather than the political duties we have as citizens. But my question concerns *political* obligations. Specifically, I'm concerned with whether and how the sate, and more specifically the liberal state, can defend animal welfare."

xiii:  "It [liberal political theory] is generally characterized by (1) an assumption of human equality and (2) a concern with preserving human liberty, usually (but not always) conceptualized as preserving individual rights from government power. Unfortunately, its focus on human liberty and human equality means that liberal political theory has been remarkably unhelpful on animal governance."

xiii:  "I take up three key liberal concepts--the social contract, property rights, and representation--and explore how they should be understood when applied to animals."

xiii:  "Liberalism may not take us as far as the more radical defenders of animal rights would like, but it does, I believe, support broader protections for animal welfare than any nation currently provides."

xiv:  "Animals (a term I will use to encompass not only mammals but also birds, fish, reptiles, and insects) are too deeply involved in the political sphere--as subjects of regulation, members of families and communities, and even workers--to be treated as mere undifferentiated, nonsentient, inanimate things. They are best understood as neither human persons nor mere things but *fellow creatures*, co-inhabitants of our ecological and social spaces."

xiv:  "our liberal theory can be based on a broad *social* consensus about the status of animals."

xiv:  "The liberalism on offer here depends on an overlapping consensus [â€¦] that some animals are members of the social contract. A liberal state that enjoys such a consensus has a sufficient social foundation for animal welfare policy, even if citizens disagree about the metaphysical principles supporting it."

xvii:  Potential objects to the project as stated and its assumptions might include: "that liberal political theory is primarily concerned with justice, and animals cannot be subjects of justice; that our relationship to animals isn't, properly speaking, 'political'; that improving our ethical relationships with animals isn't a liberal value; or that our relationships with animals are too unequal for liberal political theory to apply."

xvii:  "The animal welfare movement has been remarkably successful in making appeals to compassion, while the animal rights movement, when it appeals solely to our sense of justice, meets considerably more resistance."

xxiii:  "Our question is whether we can protect animal welfare and promote enriching animal/human relations in a way that serves--or at least does not undermine--what we value in human liberty."

	But, to be clear, the approach defended here maintains the priority of human interests over non-human interests even if there are no good reasons to maintain this priority?

xxiii:  "Most animal rights advocates emphasize similarities between human and nonhuman animals (sentience, reasoning, emotional life, and so on), and these similarities become the grounds for arguing for similar treatment under law and policy (like granting them rights). But that approach often leads animal rights activists to compare animal and human suffering, which in turn seems (to some) to trivialize human suffering. Should factory farms be compared to the Holocaust, and zoos to prison camps?"

xxv:  "The property status of animals does need some reform, but it is mass commerce in animals, result in their commodification, that deserves our concern."

	Doesn't this say, in effect, that the problem with animals isn't that they are commodities; the problem with animals is that they are commodities. This doesn't make sense.

	Like Cochrane, Smith bases her argument on Raz's version of liberalism. However, it appears as though they come to significantly and importantly different conclusions.

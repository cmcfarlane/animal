	Some problems requiring further thought:
	
	1. justifies pets on the grounds that animals have no intrinsic interest in liberty, thus, being confined qua pets is not a harm and, therefore, is permissible. However, most common pets (i.e., cats and dogs) are, respectively, natural carnivores and natural omnivores. The question, then, is how to square the dietary needs of pets against the rights of animals kept as livestock, which he determined can be eaten if they die naturally (however, this opens other problems regarding communicable disease and treatment of sick animals, which he ignores). However, it is not possible to keep domesticated food animals in sufficient quantities while recognizing their rights to produce enough food to feed cats and dogs. Consequently, either pets must be vegan or pets non-natural herbivores must be excluded as potential pets.
	2. similar problem arises vis a vis zoos. In principle, he argues that a properly designed zoo does not violate the rights of animals kept in the zoo. However, even if a zoo could be properly designed to meet the needs of animals and if such a zoo kept carnivoers or omnivores, we would have the situation where we have to violate the rights of some animals ('prey') to feed other animals ('predators').
	3.  the argument in favour of genetic engineering seems to suggest that under some conditions, not only is genetic engineering permissible, but it is mandatory. And, if it is mandatory in the case of animals, it is likely mandatory in the case of humans. But this must be absurd.
	4. does not adequately address the problem of human/environment regulations. Accepts that in most cases much development would be impermissible if it led to a rights violation of animals. Thus, development is likely limited to the existing developed footprint. This is fine (as far as it goes) and implies urban intensification as the best strategy for human development. The problem relates, primarily, to transportation: as a general rule, cities are not self-sufficient and thus necessitate transportation networks. Imagining that the existing transportation network is more or less adequate, we are left with the problem of foreseeable, but mostly unintentional killing of animals: roadkill. The same applies to trains and airplanes.
	5. argument is puzzling in that it affirms a dubious ontological divide between humans and animals. Humans are deemed to possess something resembling Kantian autonomy, however, it is readily apparent that most humans for significant periods of their lives do not live in conditions that characterize autonomy of this sort. On the other hand, because animals do not possess Kantian autonomy, it is deemed that they possess no autonomy at all, with the potential exception of primates and cetaceans. Thus, there are those who possess it, those who do not, and a few uncomfortable creatures that fall in between. This is an unsatisfactory conception of autonomy which must be described in terms of more or less, this is an unsatisfactory conception of the sort of autonomy possessed by most/many humans, and an entirely unsatisfactory conception of animals (which suggests that Cochrane is either completely unfamiliar with animals or completely unfamiliar with the ethological literature).
	
Chapter One: Introduction
---

1:  "While it is reasonable to suggest that there is a loose consensus that political communities can and ought to do much more for the well-being of both domesticated and wild animals, precisely what that 'more' requires is a subject of heated debate."

	"Anti" position constitutes Peter Carruthers, Roger Scruton and Tibor Machan. They reject "animal rights" on the basis that animals are unable to claim rights nor are they able to respect the rights of others. This does not rule out moral *concern* for animals on the part of humans, but it does rule out granting this concern on the basis of rights.
	
	"Pro" position constitutes Tom Regan, Gary Francione and Steven Wise. Rights are necessary "because they, and they alone, demand an end to all the ways in which animals are" used.
	
2:  Argues that neither position is correct. Claims that animals have significant interests that entails duties on the part of humans (against anti), but this "does not include an animal right to be liberated."

2:  "Rights possession simply means that their holders have certain important, basic interests that impose duties on others. Such an understanding of rights leads to a theory of animal rights without liberation."

3:  Animal rights theories (e.g., Francione) demand that ethics not be limited to the regulation of animals in various forms, but that all uses of animals be abolished and the animals concerned thereby liberated.

3:  "In this sense, then, animal rights are often considered to be analogous to human rights."

4:  "For Singer, equality does not require equal treatment, but equal consideration. More precisely, equality demands that we grant equal consideration to the interests of all sentient creatures."

5:  "when these twin principles of equal consideration and utility maximization are applied, policies that treat individuals differently will often emerge--but such differential treatment will be fair."

	Reception of this was mixed. On the one hand, some found it went too far in breaking down barrier between humans and animals; on the other hand, others found that it did not go far enough because it does not categorically rule out exploitation of animals so long as both principles are met.
	
6:  "For according to Regan, the most basic of rights is the right to respectful treatment, and being treated respectfully means that one must never be used merely as a means to secure the best overall consequences."

6:  "Regan's theory [â€¦] condemns every form of exploitation of animals that treats them solely as tools, instruments, or a means to improve overall consequences."

	Thus, Singer "regulates" use with the view to (1) maximize utility so long as (2) equal consideration obtains; Regan rules out all use if it is limited to treament as mere means, but this in itself does not rule out all use necessarily. Hence, Francione's view that "*all" human uses of animals" must be abolished.
	
7:  "Crucially, an explanation of the dichotomy between a Singer-influenced 'welfarism' and a Regan-influenced 'rights position' has now become a necessary ingredient in any textbook, research monograph, course, or lecture on animal ethics."

7:  "this book claims that if a properly nuanced understanding of what it means to possess rights is accepted, and if a properly nuanced understanding of the interests of animals is adopted, then a theory of animal rights without liberation logically follows."

9:  "Joel Feinberg, Bernard Rollin, and James Rachels have all claimed that animal rights derive from animals' interests. As such they have offered theories of animal rights that have a more tangible and concrete grounding than any that relies on such notions as dignity or inherent value."

9:  Adopts Joseph Raz's approach to rights; viz., "an individual has a right when that individual has an interest that is sufficient for holding someone else under a duty." Thus, rights are protections on sufficiently important interests.

9-10:  "Interests have to be identified, strengths of interests must be established, interests must be balanced against competing interests and values, and the burdens any putative right claim places on any potential duty-bearer must be assessed."

	Hence, rights are neither self-evident nor natural. 
	
10:  "The argument of this book is that when we have a proper understanding of the interests of sentient animals, there is no reason to grant animals a right never to be used, owned, and exploited by human beings. Because the vast majority of sentient animals have no intrinsic interest in liberty, they possess no fundamental right to be free, and no fundamental right to be liberated."
	
	The problem here is (1) the meaning of liberty and its connection to freedom and (2) how "interest" can be defined such that it does not preclude exploitation: how can it ever be in a creature's *interest* to be *exploited*?
	
11:  "Most sentient animals have no intrinsic interest in liberty, the book claims, because they lack the capacities of autonomous agency. That is, the majority of sentient animals lack the ability to frame, revise, and pursue their own conception of the good."

	This gives too much to humans and not enough to animals. On the one hand, humans may be able to conceive the good, but they are rarely endowed with the capacities to realize this good, but these limitations natural, physical or sociological. On the other hand, there is no good reason to privilege long-range good determining over short-range good determining. Animals clearly express short-term preferences for their own good which operates at the individual level and does not coincide in all members of a species. Take any two dogs or cats living in the same house. 
	
11:  "the claim is not that *all* nonhuman animals possess no intrinsic interest in liberty; rather, it is that the vast majority of them do not."

	Admits that cetaceans and great apes may possess requisite autonomy. As a result, "a precautionary principle is probably wise" in these cases.
	
12:  "The second point of clarification is that this book does not deny the obvious point that all kinds of uses, exploitation, and ownership of animals cause harm to animals. Depriving animals of liberty through confining them in cages and stalls, or through using them to model painful and deadly diseases, obviously inflicts serious harms on them. However, the claim of this book is that it is the pain, suffering, and death that cause the harm in such instances, not the use itself."

	Introduces a distinction between instrumental and intrinsic interests in liberty. Animals only possess an instrumental interest. Confinement is not bad for animals; the suffering, pain and death that derives from confinement is had for animals. On the other hand, humans have an intrinsic interest in liberty. For interest, the case of "The Truman Show" where the main character leads an excellent life but is not aware that he is confined in an artifical town. Opposed to this, he claims that so long as animals are not harmed (i.e., caused to suffer or experience pain or death) in being used in movies, we should not consider such uses bad because it is not as though the dog could choose to behave otherwise. This is ludicrous. While many dogs have particular talents for performance, this does not mean that all dogs do. Some dogs enjoy sports; others do not. Some dogs enjoy fetch or swimming; others do not. Throwing a dog in the water even if there is no chance of the dog drowning and if the dog does not suffer any more than a child experiencing the same is a harm to that dog (or child). An animal given an opportunity for training and who clearly enjoys training is likely benefitted from being enabled to act upon that training; hence, it is "okay" to use that animal in entertainment. An animal that is forced into training, is not given an opportunity to explore other interests, and the like, is clearly harmed in this. 
	
13:  "the book claims that animals possess prima facie moral rights not to be made to suffer and not to be killed."

13:  "Instead the language of rights immediately implies that this treatment of animals is a matter of *justice*. That is, it is a matter that pertains to what individuals can be legitimately coerced to comply with."

14:  "The account of the moral rights of animals provided in this book thus proposes what the legal rights of animals *ought to be*."

14:  "it provides an account of those that the state can legitimately make individuals [i.e., humans?] comply with."

	This does not preclude other potential duties on the part of individuals--"benevolence, generosity, or charity"--but it does limit the enforcement of those duties in that the state has no business here.

Chapter Two: Animals, Interests, and Rights
---

21:  "the notion that sentient animals possess moral status involves at least two separate assumptions. The first is that there *are* some animals with sentience. The second is that those animals with sentience have the necessary characteristic for moral status."

21-4:  Evidence in favour of animal sentience: behavioral (act as though they are responding to stimuli), neurological (possess the same basic equipment as humans), mental experience (to consciously act upon previous two). Seems likely that all vertebrates (mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians) possess these free characteristics. In the case of insects, arachnids, crustaceans, molluscs, and cephalopods, there is little evidence that they are both capable of feeling pain and are conscious. 

24:  "Sentience signifies that an entity has the capacity for well-being."

24-8:  Despite sentience and connection to capacity for well-being, some deny that animals have welfare interests, a concept which is rightly limited to humans. Three general grounds for this claim. First, religious (e.g., *imago Dei*). Second, unique capacities possessed by humans; viz., moral agency and autonomy. Problem, of course, is that not all humans possess these capacities and we deem them to be morally significant even when they don't. Third, even if the point about human non-persons is accepted, some (e.g., Cohen & Fox) defend their moral status on the grounds of kind--they belong to the humankind even if they do not possess the ordinary characteristics of the kind. However, there are no grounds specified for why *human* kind is the relevant kind and not the kind constituted by the living, the sentient, the organic, etc.

28:  "In light of all this, the interesting question is not *whether* we have obligations to sentient nonhuman animals, but just *what* obligations we have to them."

28-9:  "The argument of this book is that just as well-being is the necessary and sufficient condition for the possession of moral status, so it is the necessary and sufficient condition for the possession of rights."

	There are a number of possible objections to the view that interests confer rights in the case of animals.
	
30:  Moral agency is required--however, this does not work in marginal cases, which is perverse. That is, moral agency resides in reciprocity (right<=>duty) and capacity for both elements must be present in order to speak of moral agency. 

32:  Relation--rights do not reside *in* individuals, but in the relations *between* individuals. "To assign rights outside the context of meaningful social relations, it is argued, is implausible." But, the argument is not comprehensive. For instance, some rights are said to obtain even when there are no social ties or social ties of sufficient density. Thus, the objection cannot be about rights as such, but about the content of rights in a given context. Close relations can reinforce rights claims, but a lack of close relations does not negate rights. Position associated with Elizabeth Anderson.

34:  Lack interests--while animals have welfare (can suffer or thrive), they do not have an interest in their life going one way or the other because they cannot form concerns about the course of their life. Position associated with RJ Frey and HJ McCloskey.

36:  Interests beyond sentience--not clear how Cochrane imagines this as an argument against animals having interests because this view ascribes interests beyond sentient animals to plants and inanimate objects. Cochrane seems to take this as a *reductio* (if cups have interests, then the concept is meaningless, therefore animals have no interests). But, Matthew Kramer, who Cochrane is quoting, does not intend for his argument to be a *reductio*, but a necessary conclusion.

37:  "This section leaves aside the issue of whether it is ludicrous to assign rights to plants and inanimate objects. That question is immaterial because quite simply it is a serious mistake to see plants and inanimate objects as possessors of interests."

39:  Protection of interests can be taken up in two possible ways: utilitarian maximization of interests or recognition of rights. 

40:  The problem with utilitarianism is well-known: ""*individual* well-being can and ought to be sacrificed should it lead to higher *aggregate* well-being."

41:  "Using rights immediately recognizes that there are limits to what can be done to the individual in the name of aggregate well-being."

41:  Grounding rights in interests is more satisfactory than other versions of rights as moral rights; e.g., Regan's theory. "there is no plausible means of explaining where moral rights come from and how they are justified."

42:  "having an interest in something does not mean that one automatically has a right to that thing. [â€¦] to have a right the interest must be *suffucient* to give grounds for holding another to be under a duty."

43:  "it is an approach that uses moral reasoning to come up with a set of legal rules that political communities ought to enforce."

45:  "An interest-based approach can deal effectively with conflicts of rights if it employs the distinction between prima facie and concrete rights. Prima facie rights are those rights that exist at a more abstract level outside of specific circumstances. In effect, then, prima facie rights are not 'all things considered' rights, but rights that are established via a more general judgment about whether an interest is sufficient to impose a duty on another. Crucially for our purposes, prima facie rights can meaningfully conflict and will inevitably conflict. Concrete rights, on the other hand, do not conflict. Concrete rights are 'all things considered' rights and are established by close attention to specific circumstances of any particular case. These rights consider every detail of a situation to judge whether an interest is sufficient to impose a duty on another. Concrete rights resolve conflicts between prima facie rights and have peremptory force--finally determining what ought to be done."

Chapter Three: Animal Experimentation
---

51:  Introduces distinction between "therapeutic" and nontherapeutic" animal experimentation. The former comprise biomedical experimentation and "includes those procedures that are carried out to research diseases and biological processes, to develop new drugs, and to test drugs for safety." The latter "includes those procedures that are carried out for general biological research, for educational purposes, and for the testing of household products and cosmetics on animals." Genetic engineering is treated in a separate chapter.

52:  "whether animals possess an interest that is sufficient, all things considered, to impose a moral duty on us not to experiment on them."

52:  "animal experiments that result in pain or death are morally illegitimate, while painless experiments in which the animal does not die are permissible, all else being equal."

53:  "two broad criteria that determine the strength of an interest: the value of the particular good to the well-being of the individual; and the level of psychological continuity between the individual now and when the good or goods will occur."

53-4:  criteria for determining strength of interest: "value to the individual in question" (but, "should not be taken from this understanding of interests that they are purely subjective"); "the relationship between the individual at the time when we attribute the interest and the individual when that interest will be satisfied" (Jeff McMahan's "psychological continuity").

54:  "a future good will provide more value to an individual the more that he or she can identify with the future self who receives that good."

56:  Because of the strength of this [not to suffer] interest, there is good reason to acknowledge that animals, like humans, have a prima facie right not to be made to suffer. What I mean by this is that sentient animals can be considered to possess a *general* right not to be made to suffer."

57:  While there is a prima facie right not to be made to suffer, this does not imply that there is a necessary concrete right not to be made to suffer. This could be argued on three grounds: the benefits of the experiment outweigh the suffering imposed; obligations to humans override obligations to animals; or that human life is simply more valuable than non-human life.

57:  The first counter-argument can only apply to therapeutic experimentation and never to nontherapeutic experimentation if it is to remain coherent for the simple reason that the benefits conferred by curing disease (for instance) outweigh the benefits conferred by better smelling cleaning products (for instance). 

58:  "animal experiments may provide widespread therapeutic benefits *and* be morally impermissible." Even if we assume that medical experimentation can and does provide benefits, this is not sufficient to legitimate animal experimentation. But, it is important to note that if experiments of this sort on *animals* confer great benefits, directly performing the experiments on *humans* would confer even greater benefits. However, no one deems this to be legitimate despite the obvious potential gains.

64:  While it is clear that animals have an interest in not being made to suffer in experimentation, it doesn't necessarily follow that animals have an interest in not being killed in experimentation. This depends upon animals having an interest in continuing lives. Thus, it is conceivable that if anesthetized and painlessly killed, then animal experimentation would be permissible.

65:  Suffering and being dead are two different states. There is a feeling associated with suffering; there is no possible feeling associated with being dead because feelings are not properties of the dead.

66:  "[animal rights] philosophers tend to argue that death harms sentient animals because it forecloses their opportunities for future valuable experiences."

67:  "the animal interest in continued life is weaker than that of human persons for three reasons: animals lack the capacity to take immediate satisfaction from the prospect of continued life; they do not possess future self-chosen goals and projects to pursue; and they possess weaker psychological continuity with their future selves."

69:  "We are thus effectively left with two choices. First, we could simply conclude that it is legitimate to conduct painless but deadly experiments on *both* animals and humans who lack these capacities. However, even utilitarians, aiming to maximize overall welfare, balk at embracing such conclusions. And no doubt almost all of us would regard this option as too costly to embrace. Alternatively, then, we might have to conclude that the interest in continued life of both humans and non-humans is sufficiently strong to ground in us a duty not to kill them by experimentation."

71:  "perhaps animals have a more general interest in not being experimented upon: perhaps they have an interest in not being *used* in experimentation."

73:  "nonconsensual interference, constraint, and use are not *in themselves* harmful to animal nonpersons, as they are for human persons."

78:  "If scientists experiment on animals in ways that cause no pain and that do not end in death, then such experiments are permissible."

Chapter Four: Animal Agriculture
---

79:  "the most regular and direct contact many of us have with animals comes through eating their flesh, their milk, and their eggs."

80:  "animals have concrete rights not to be killed or made to suffer when being raised for food. This, of course, has radical implications for agricultural policy: it implies that raising animals for food can only ever be permissible when it does not cause animals suffering and does not result in killing them."

83:  "No quality of life is available to animals who suffer the horrors of intensive farming practices. As such, it can only be concluded that animals have an interest in not suffering that is sufficient to impose a duty on us not to intensively farm them."

84:  "the human interest in being free to eat animals is only trivial. In contrast, the animal interest in continued life is fundamental."

85:  "I think it is only reasonable to concede that there is a price to be paid for shutting down the meat industry."

86:  "So if we are to raise animals for their milk and eggs permissibly, it is necessary that we raise them in accordance with their well-being. This will require an end to intensive farming practices and will result in more expensive dairy products."

100:  Quoting Gaverick Matheny, "Least Harm": "crop production uses less than half as many hectares as grass-fed dairy and one-tenth as many hectares as grass-fed beef to deliver the same amount of protein." And, taking field animal deaths into account during sowing/reaping, kills fewer animals in total than other systems of agriculture.

101:  "it is consistent to say that livestock animals have a right not to be killed by us in agriculture, but that field animals do not."

102:  "reflection over the best agricultural policy in terms of animal deaths cannot be detached from questions about the ever-expanding numbers of humans on the planet."

Chapter Five: Animals and Genetic Engineering
---

103:  "genetic engineering is a technique primarily employed in medical experimentation and in agriculture: to model particular genetic diseases, and to select certain traits that are desirable for farmers."

104:  "Rights are properly established by an assessment of the current and existing interests of individuals--not on the basis of their potentiality."

104:  "the relevant question under consideration in this chapter is whether animals have a moral right not to *have been* engineered."

105:  "animals have no interest in not having been engineered with opportunities for well-being equivalent to or higher than ordinary members of their species. As such, engineering that affords engineered animals these types of opportunities is ordinarily permissible."

	Does this mean that animals have an interest in being genetically engineered if it improves their well-being beyond that of ordinary members of their species?
	
115:  "Since it contributes nothing to their well-being, dogs have no interest in having been created with a wagging tail."

117:  "First, animals possess the right not to have been engineered with lives that are so full of suffering that their lives are not worth living. This right imposes strict limitations on engineering, particularly given the somewhat random nature of the technology as it currently stands. Second, animals possess the right to have been engineered with 'sufficient' opportunities for well-being, where sufficient is defined as similar to those possessed by ordinary members of their species."

118:  "Adopting a 'precautionary principle' seems apt when we are embarking on such radical alterations of sentient beings."

118:  "The onus must be on engineers to prove that their actions will not cause lives of intolerable suffering for the engineered animals."

	Is *intolerable* really the right criterion in this context? Mild? Horrible? Moderate? These are all acceptable?
	
119:  "If animals are engineered with diseases but with lives that are minimally worth living, then it might be hard to see how any of their rights have been violated."

119:  "we cannot say that these animals engineered animals have either an *interest* or a *right* in not having been engineered with diseases or disabilities."

122:  "an individual can be harmed by an action, even if that action leaves him or her no worse off."

122:  "Although animals are not made worse off for having been engineered with diseases or disabilities, they have nevertheless been harmed."

Chapter Six: Animal Entertainment
---

128:  "animals have no right not to be used for our entertainment but do have the rights not to be killed or made to suffer when being so used. As such, this section argues that political communities are under no obligation to abolish all the ways in which they use animals for entertainment but do have to radically overhaul those practices in order to make them permissible."

131:  "If it is correct that animals have a concrete moral right not to be killed or made to suffer through their use as pets, then pet keeping must be regulated much more rigorously than it is in contemporary political communities."

	For instance, licencing or "background checks" comparable to those adoptive parents of humans must go through.

135:  "so long as the parent animals are not made to suffer in the process, there can be nothing wrong in itself with creating animals through more conventional breeding."

135:  "animals have a moral right to have been bred with sufficient opportunities for well-being."

136:  Summary of requirements for pet licences: "they prove that they have sufficient time, resources, and understanding to maintain the well-being of the particular animal in question; they take out pet insurance in case of disease or accident; and they agree to take responsibility for the well-being of any offspring that are produced as a result of accidental mating or deliberate breeding."

	Oddly, does not address the issue of pet diets: i.e., cats are natural carnivores and dogs are natural omnivores. Given that we bring pets into the world intentionally, we have a conflict between obligations to pets (provide food) and obligations for "agricultural" animals (not use them as food). While the issue is different in terms of wolf/deer (wolf has right to eat deer; we have no obligation to interfere), Cochrane maintains that there is an obligation to keep cats indoors so as to disallow them to kill small animals and birds--some of which they may eat. 
	
152:  "it is not ordinarily permissible to take possession of an animal existing in the wild."

152:  "the transfer of possession of animals should be much more restricted than is currently permitted."

Chapter Seven: Animals and the Environment
---

156:  "our environmental obligations should not be founded on a 'biocentric' ethic that assigns moral status and rights to all living entities. Instead, the chapter proposes a 'welfare-centric' ethic that delineates our environmental obligations from the interests and rights of individual sentient beings."

156:  "In philosophical terms, mainstream environmentalism is clearly 'anthropocentric.' That is, politicians, activists, and the public have become increasingly concerned about such issues as pollution, climate change, and resource depletion because of the threats and harms they pose to human beings."

157:  "first, that nonconscious entities such as plants, species, and ecosystems cannot possess interests; second, that these same entities do not possess moral status; and finally, that a full and demanding account of our moral obligations concerning the environment can be arrived at from a theory based on the interests and rights of sentient individual animals."

158:  "For although events can make the biological functioning of plants better or worse, nothing can make life better or worse *for the plants themselves*."

158:  "No nonconscious entity such as a plant, species, or ecosystem can posses interests under this account; and thus no such entity can possess moral status or rights."

159:  "This is where conscious experience becomes so important for the possession of interests: not to have the capacity to be consciously interested in a good, but to have the capacity to *experience the benefit* of that good."

162:  "the well-being of sentient individuals is absolutely dependent on the health of nonconscious nature."

162:  "When formulating our obligations with respect to the environment, not only must the interests of human beings be accounted for, but so must the interests of all sentient creatures."

163:  "[John] Hadley ingeniously proposes that nonhuman animals have property rights over their habitats."

	Citing: Hadley, John. "Nonhuman Animal Property: Reconciling Environmentalism and Animal Rights." *Journal of Social Philosophy* 36 (2005): 305-15.
	
174:  "Therapeutic hunting generally refers to that form of killing animals that is done not for entertainment, trophies, subsistence, or cultural reasons, but to manage wildlife. Simply put, therapeutic hunting refers to those policies of killing wild animals that aim to prevent overpopulation and eradicate or minimize nonnative species."

Chapter Eight: Animals and Cultural Practices
---

182:  Three types of arguments are made on behalf of human cultural practices and against the rights of animals: (1) "the human interest in culture trumps the interests of animals," (2) "the human interest in freedom of religion trumps the interests of animals," (3) cultural relativism--local cultures are not to be judged on the basis of criteria generated external to that culture.

Chapter Nine: Conclusion
---

204-5:  "For there is now an assumption that animal welfarism must be a welfarism of the kind proposed by Singer, and that an animal rights theory must be a rights theory of the kind proposed by Regan."

207:  "In other words, this book has proposed a set of duties to animals that the state can legitimately make individuals comply with. SO, on the one hand, political communities ought to change their legal rules so that they can recognize, uphold, and protect the animal rights outlined and defended in this book. And on the other, citizens ought to comply with the duties entailed by these rights, as far as that is possible in present circumstances, and ought to campaign for their political community to enact the legal changes necessary to put these rights into practice."

207-9:  Comments at length on the process of social/political change:

> For it may be pointed out that our powers of persuasion--and particularly in relation to the treatment of animals--are somewhat limited. Without doubt there are a number of entrenched and structural obstacles to successfully persuading contemporary political communities that they ought to transform the ways in which they treat nonhuman sentient animals. Clearly there are cultural obstacles. Most Western societies, for example, simply take it for granted that human beings are of supreme moral value, and that nonhumans count for little. Part of the explanation for this cultural attitude of course stems from Judeo-Christian Christian teachings about the special relationship between humans and God--teachings that have been accepted and become embedded over centuries. There are also important material obstacles. Indeed, many of the grossest animal rights violations are committed by agricultural and pharmaceutical businesses with huge resources. Crucially, these are just the kind of resources that governments and political leaders covet and are loathe to shy away from. Our powers of persuasion are also limited by power imbalances between humans and animals. Quite simply, most sentient animals lack the capabilities to speak up and campaign for their own better treatment. This means that animals are necessarily reliant on the motivation and action of human representatives to fight for their cause.

> Given all these impediments to our ability to engage with and inform democratic procedures, it can legitimately be asked how far the strategies of representation, discourse, debate, and persuasion can go. Some campaigners might ask themselves why billions of animals have to suffer so horribly while we forlornly attempt to convince the public that such suffering actually matters. Is democratic underlaboring inevitably doomed to propping up the status quo? If so, are more direct and even violent political interventions justified for the sake of animal rights?

> It is my firm belief that they are not. It is crucial that we do not lose sight of democratic procedures for the establishment and promotion of animals rights, for at least three reasons. First, the process of democratic engagement calls for this theory--and any other--to be opened up to public scrutiny. Such a process is absolutely vital before any steps toward policy implementation are taken. It would, after all, be rather strange if this particular book had hit on the absolutely truthful account of our obligations to animals! Just as there are flaws with theories of animal ethics that have gone before it, there are no doubt flaws with the theory of animal rights proposed here. This is not to go back on the arguments that have been made throughout the book--they are offered with the sincere belief that this account is more compelling and plausible than the alternatives. However, it is to admit to fallibility--and hence the idea that all theories should be open to scrutiny, questioned, amended, improved, or even abandoned, as is deemed necessary.

> Democratic underlabouring is also crucial for the sake of legitimacy. The rights proposed in this book are urgent and compelling. The way contemporary societies disregard the interests of nonhuman animals is shocking, and the horrific abuse inflicted upon animals for the most trivial of reasons should be a source of collective shame. However, the appropriate response to these harms and rights violations is not simply to institutionalize and uphold these rights at any cost. Violating basic human rights for the sake of promoting the rights of animals, for example, would obviously be illegitimate, as well as counterproductive. If animal rights are to have political legitimacy, then, it is crucial that they have been arrived at through just democratic procedures. That does not mean, however, that campaigners should just sit around and wait for the political will to emerge. Instead, it means that campaigners should do all they can within those just strategies to establish, foster, and promote that political will. Of course, there are serious and important impediments to realizing that will, as described above. But to think that we have no power or means by which to address and even to overcome those obstacles seems unjustifiably pessimistic. After all, advances in other areas of social justice have taken place across many political communities in spite of similarly powerful obstacles.

> Finally, it is crucial that democratic procedures and strategies are followed for the sake of the protection of animals themselves. After all, without any kind of democratic support for these rights, not only will legislation protecting them lack political legitimacy, but it will also lack any realistic chance of achieving lasting effects for animals. Citizens will resist and disobey the laws, and governments will lack the will and energy to enforce them. The process of democratic underlaboring--of doing everything in our power to persuade political communities of the validity of these rights--is thus absolutely essential if these animals rights are to be upheld, protected, and enjoyed over the long term.

Chapter One: Introduction
---

1:  "While it is reasonable to suggest that there is a loose consensus that political communities can and ought to do much more for the well-being of both domesticated and wild animals, precisely what that 'more' requires is a subject of heated debate."

	"Anti" position constitutes Peter Carruthers, Roger Scruton and Tibor Machan. They reject "animal rights" on the basis that animals are unable to claim rights nor are they able to respect the rights of others. This does not rule out moral *concern* for animals on the part of humans, but it does rule out granting this concern on the basis of rights.
	
	"Pro" position constitutes Tom Regan, Gary Francione and Steven Wise. Rights are necessary "because they, and they alone, demand an end to all the ways in which animals are" used.
	
2:  Argues that neither position is correct. Claims that animals have significant interests that entails duties on the part of humans (against anti), but this "does not include an animal right to be liberated."

2:  "Rights possession simply means that their holders have certain important, basic interests that impose duties on others. Such an understanding of rights leads to a theory of animal rights without liberation."

3:  Animal rights theories (e.g., Francione) demand that ethics not be limited to the regulation of animals in various forms, but that all uses of animals be abolished and the animals concerned thereby liberated.

3:  "In this sense, then, animal rights are often considered to be analogous to human rights."

4:  "For Singer, equality does not require equal treatment, but equal consideration. More precisely, equality demands that we grant equal consideration to the interests of all sentient creatures."

5:  "when these twin principles of equal consideration and utility maximization are applied, policies that treat individuals differently will often emerge--but such differential treatment will be fair."

	Reception of this was mixed. On the one hand, some found it went too far in breaking down barrier between humans and animals; on the other hand, others found that it did not go far enough because it does not categorically rule out exploitation of animals so long as both principles are met.
	
6:  "For according to Regan, the most basic of rights is the right to respectful treatment, and being treated respectfully means that one must never be used merely as a means to secure the best overall consequences."

6:  "Regan's theory [â€¦] condemns every form of exploitation of animals that treats them solely as tools, instruments, or a means to improve overall consequences."

	Thus, Singer "regulates" use with the view to (1) maximize utility so long as (2) equal consideration obtains; Regan rules out all use if it is limited to treament as mere means, but this in itself does not rule out all use necessarily. Hence, Francione's view that "*all" human uses of animals" must be abolished.
	
7:  "Crucially, an explanation of the dichotomy between a Singer-influenced 'welfarism' and a Regan-influenced 'rights position' has now become a necessary ingredient in any textbook, research monograph, course, or lecture on animal ethics."

7:  "this book claims that if a properly nuanced understanding of what it means to possess rights is accepted, and if a properly nuanced understanding of the interests of animals is adopted, then a theory of animal rights without liberation logically follows."

9:  "Joel Feinberg, Bernard Rollin, and James Rachels have all claimed that animal rights derive from animals' interests. As such they have offered theories of animal rights that have a more tangible and concrete grounding than any that relies on such notions as dignity or inherent value."

9:  Adopts Joseph Raz's approach to rights; viz., "an individual has a right when that individual has an interest that is sufficient for holding someone else under a duty." Thus, rights are protections on sufficiently important interests.

9-10:  "Interests have to be identified, strengths of interests must be established, interests must be balanced against competing interests and values, and the burdens any putative right claim places on any potential duty-bearer must be assessed."

	Hence, rights are neither self-evident nor natural. 
	
10:  "The argument of this book is that when we have a proper understanding of the interests of sentient animals, there is no reason to grant animals a right never to be used, owned, and exploited by human beings. Because the vast majority of sentient animals have no intrinsic interest in liberty, they possess no fundamental right to be free, and no fundamental right to be liberated."
	
	The problem here is (1) the meaning of liberty and its connection to freedom and (2) how "interest" can be defined such that it does not preclude exploitation: how can it ever be in a creature's *interest* to be *exploited*?
	
11:  "Most sentient animals have no intrinsic interest in liberty, the book claims, because they lack the capacities of autonomous agency. That is, the majority of sentient animals lack the ability to frame, revise, and pursue their own conception of the good."

	This gives too much to humans and not enough to animals. On the one hand, humans may be able to conceive the good, but they are rarely endowed with the capacities to realize this good, but these limitations natural, physical or sociological. On the other hand, there is no good reason to privilege long-range good determining over short-range good determining. Animals clearly express short-term preferences for their own good which operates at the individual level and does not coincide in all members of a species. Take any two dogs or cats living in the same house. 
	
11:  "the claim is not that *all* nonhuman animals possess no intrinsic interest in liberty; rather, it is that the vast majority of them do not."

	Admits that cetaceans and great apes may possess requisite autonomy. As a result, "a precautionary principle is probably wise" in these cases.
	
12:  "The second point of clarification is that this book does not deny the obvious point that all kinds of uses, exploitation, and ownership of animals cause harm to animals. Depriving animals of liberty through confining them in cages and stalls, or through using them to model painful and deadly diseases, obviously inflicts serious harms on them. However, the claim of this book is that it is the pain, suffering, and death that cause the harm in such instances, not the use itself."

	Introduces a distinction between instrumental and intrinsic interests in liberty. Animals only possess an instrumental interest. Confinement is not bad for animals; the suffering, pain and death that derives from confinement is had for animals. On the other hand, humans have an intrinsic interest in liberty. For interest, the case of "The Truman Show" where the main character leads an excellent life but is not aware that he is confined in an artifical town. Opposed to this, he claims that so long as animals are not harmed (i.e., caused to suffer or experience pain or death) in being used in movies, we should not consider such uses bad because it is not as though the dog could choose to behave otherwise. This is ludicrous. While many dogs have particular talents for performance, this does not mean that all dogs do. Some dogs enjoy sports; others do not. Some dogs enjoy fetch or swimming; others do not. Throwing a dog in the water even if there is no chance of the dog drowning and if the dog does not suffer any more than a child experiencing the same is a harm to that dog (or child). An animal given an opportunity for training and who clearly enjoys training is likely benefitted from being enabled to act upon that training; hence, it is "okay" to use that animal in entertainment. An animal that is forced into training, is not given an opportunity to explore other interests, and the like, is clearly harmed in this. 
	
13:  "the book claims that animals possess prima facie moral rights not to be made to suffer and not to be killed."

13:  "Instead the language of rights immediately implies that this treatment of animals is a matter of *justice*. That is, it is a matter that pertains to what individuals can be legitimately coerced to comply with."

14:  "The account of the moral rights of animals provided in this book thus proposes what the legal rights of animals *ought to be*."

14:  "it provides an account of those that the state can legitimately make individuals [i.e., humans?] comply with."

	This does not preclude other potential duties on the part of individuals--"benevolence, generosity, or charity"--but it does limit the enforcement of those duties in that the state has no business here.

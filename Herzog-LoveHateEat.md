Introduction: Why Is It So Hard to Think Straight About Animals?

2:  "ex-vegetarians, a club that outnumbers current vegetarians in the United States by a ratio of three to one."

5:  "Is having a pet that gets its daily ration of meat from a can of cat food morally preferable to living with a snake?"

6:  "With about 94 million cats in America, the numbers add up. If each cat consumes just two ounces of meat daily, en masse, they consume nearly 12 million pounds of flesh--the equivalen of 3 million chickens--every single day."

6:  "It is likely that at least ten times as many furry and feathered creatures are killed each year as a result of our love of cats than are used in biomedical experiments."

6:  "Objectively, the moral burden of enjoying the company of a cat is ten times higher than that of living with a pet snake."

Chapter 1: Anthrozoology: The New Science of Human-Animal Interactions
---

17:  "We [anthrozoologists] all believe that our interactions with other species are an important component of human life and hope that our research might make the lives of animals better."

18:  "One of the most important topics in anthrozoology is whether interacting with animals can alleviate human suffering."

31:  "An analysis of 354 cases of serial murders found that nearly 80% of the perpetrators did not have a known history of cruelty to animals. The connection between school shootings and animal cruelty is even more tenuous."

32:  "The bad seed hypothesis holds that animal abuse is not a cause of delinquincy, but a sign of a seriously troubled child, many of whom will become psychopathic adults."

32:  "the violence graduation hypothesis. THis ist he idea that pulling the wings off butterflies or beating a dog is the first in a series of steps that can eventually end in prison. [â€¦] One implication of this theory is that animal abuse in children can be used as a form of profiling, a way of identifying the potential serial killers and school shooters before their violence escalates."

33:  "In one recent study of college students, 66% of male students and 40% of female students admitted that they had abused animals. Arluke has come up with a radical suggestion. He believes that for many children, animal cruelty is a normal part of growing up."

34:  "But the fact remains that childhood animal abuse is more common than is generally recognized."

Chapter 2: The Importance of Being Cute: Why We Think What We Think About Creatures That Don't Think Like Us
---

38:  "The ways that we think about animals are often determined by species's characteristics--how attractive the creatures are, their size, the shape of their head, whether they are furry (good) or slimy (bad), and how closely they resemble humans."

39:  "The paradoxes that plague our interactions with other species are due to the fact that much of our thinking is a mire of instinct, learning, language, culture, intuition, and our reliance on mental shortcuts."

39:  Referring to Lorenz: "The notion that humans are innately drawn to anything that looks like a baby--infants, puppies, ducklings, you name it--is called the 'cute response.'"

41:  "But if people are *biophilic* towards creatures like puppies and baby seals, they are *biophobic* toward others--snakes, for instance."

43:  "the primate brain was shaped by evolution to specialize in visually detecting snakes."

45:  "The words we use for meat help us avoid thinking about the ethical implications of our diet."

46:  "animals in the category 'pet' are named; animals in the category 'research subject' are usually not. When I recently asked a biologist if any of the mice in his lab had names, he looked at me as if I were crazy. I wasn't surprised. After all, the white mice he pokes, probes, and injects are essentially identical. Why should they merit names?"

49:  "The anthrozoologist James Serpell has developed a simple and elegant perspective on cultural differences in how we think about different species. He believes that our attitudes toward animals boil down to two dimensions. The first is how we feel emotionally about the species ('affect'). On the positive side, there is love and sympathy, and on the negative side, there is fear and loathing. The other dimension is 'utility'--whether the species is useful or beneficial to human interests (perhaps we eat it or use it for transportation) or detrimental to our interests (for example, it eats us)."

55:  "of all the ethical principles he examined using many different types of trolley problems, [Lewis] Petrinovich found that the single most powerful more rule was '*Save people over animals*.'"

Chapter 3: Pet-O-Philia: Why Do Humans (And Only Humans) Love Pets?
---

72:  Referring to Keith Thomas: "pets are animals that are allowed in the house, given a name, and never eaten."

73:  Referring to James Serpell: "pets are animals we live with that have no obvious function."

78:  "The estimated lifetime cost of pet ownership is about $8,000 for a medium size dog and $10,000 for a cat (that's because cats live longer). But what kind of bang are you getting for your pet buck?"

79:  "The demography of pet-keeping also presents a problem for the unconditional love hypothesis. This view predicts that people living alone would have the most need for unconditional love and thus have the highest levels of pet ownership. This is not the case. In fact, adults living alone have the lowest rates of pet ownership, while adults raising school-aged kids have the highest. Interestingly, while adults with children have the highest rates of pet ownership, as a group, they are less attached to their animals than people who live alone with pets. In fact, pet attachment drops a notch with each additional person added to a family. Pets in homes with young children really get the shaft. For example, only about 25% of pets in families with children are groomed every day compared to nearly 80% of pets who reside with adults who do not have kids. Dogs and cats in childless homes are the ones most likely to be showered with Christmas presents and go on family vacations. Sadly, the dog that was 'our baby' during the first years of a couple's marriage is often demoted the moment their first child comes home from the hospital."

Chapter 4: Friends, Foes, and Fashion Statements: The Human-Dog Relationship
---

106:  "But if humans did not tame wolves, how did they become our pals? [Ray] Coppinger says they tamed themselves. He traces the emergence of dogs to the time people began to give up the nomadic life and settle into permanent villages. Settlements generate piles of refuse, potential gold mines for opportunistic scavengers. Wolves who were less nervous around humans would be more efficient garbage-pickers, just like the dogs-gone-wild you can see today hanging around garbage dumps on the outskirts of Lagos or Mexico City or Istanbul. These animals would have been better nourished than their warier competitors, hence bearing more offspring--puppies that would share their parents' genes for being less fearful of humans. Over generations, these tamer animals would have access to more food and eventually adapt to living around people. This self-domestication process would set the stage for unconscious selective breeding for functional traits like barking at strangers and chasing game."

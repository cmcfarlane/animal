Introduction: Why Is It So Hard to Think Straight About Animals?
---

2:  "ex-vegetarians, a club that outnumbers current vegetarians in the United States by a ratio of three to one."

5:  "Is having a pet that gets its daily ration of meat from a can of cat food morally preferable to living with a snake?"

6:  "With about 94 million cats in America, the numbers add up. If each cat consumes just two ounces of meat daily, en masse, they consume nearly 12 million pounds of flesh--the equivalen of 3 million chickens--every single day."

6:  "It is likely that at least ten times as many furry and feathered creatures are killed each year as a result of our love of cats than are used in biomedical experiments."

6:  "Objectively, the moral burden of enjoying the company of a cat is ten times higher than that of living with a pet snake."

Chapter 1: Anthrozoology: The New Science of Human-Animal Interactions
---

17:  "We [anthrozoologists] all believe that our interactions with other species are an important component of human life and hope that our research might make the lives of animals better."

18:  "One of the most important topics in anthrozoology is whether interacting with animals can alleviate human suffering."

31:  "An analysis of 354 cases of serial murders found that nearly 80% of the perpetrators did not have a known history of cruelty to animals. The connection between school shootings and animal cruelty is even more tenuous."

32:  "The bad seed hypothesis holds that animal abuse is not a cause of delinquincy, but a sign of a seriously troubled child, many of whom will become psychopathic adults."

32:  "the violence graduation hypothesis. THis ist he idea that pulling the wings off butterflies or beating a dog is the first in a series of steps that can eventually end in prison. […] One implication of this theory is that animal abuse in children can be used as a form of profiling, a way of identifying the potential serial killers and school shooters before their violence escalates."

33:  "In one recent study of college students, 66% of male students and 40% of female students admitted that they had abused animals. Arluke has come up with a radical suggestion. He believes that for many children, animal cruelty is a normal part of growing up."

34:  "But the fact remains that childhood animal abuse is more common than is generally recognized."

Chapter 2: The Importance of Being Cute: Why We Think What We Think About Creatures That Don't Think Like Us
---

38:  "The ways that we think about animals are often determined by species's characteristics--how attractive the creatures are, their size, the shape of their head, whether they are furry (good) or slimy (bad), and how closely they resemble humans."

39:  "The paradoxes that plague our interactions with other species are due to the fact that much of our thinking is a mire of instinct, learning, language, culture, intuition, and our reliance on mental shortcuts."

39:  Referring to Lorenz: "The notion that humans are innately drawn to anything that looks like a baby--infants, puppies, ducklings, you name it--is called the 'cute response.'"

41:  "But if people are *biophilic* towards creatures like puppies and baby seals, they are *biophobic* toward others--snakes, for instance."

43:  "the primate brain was shaped by evolution to specialize in visually detecting snakes."

45:  "The words we use for meat help us avoid thinking about the ethical implications of our diet."

46:  "animals in the category 'pet' are named; animals in the category 'research subject' are usually not. When I recently asked a biologist if any of the mice in his lab had names, he looked at me as if I were crazy. I wasn't surprised. After all, the white mice he pokes, probes, and injects are essentially identical. Why should they merit names?"

49:  "The anthrozoologist James Serpell has developed a simple and elegant perspective on cultural differences in how we think about different species. He believes that our attitudes toward animals boil down to two dimensions. The first is how we feel emotionally about the species ('affect'). On the positive side, there is love and sympathy, and on the negative side, there is fear and loathing. The other dimension is 'utility'--whether the species is useful or beneficial to human interests (perhaps we eat it or use it for transportation) or detrimental to our interests (for example, it eats us)."

55:  "of all the ethical principles he examined using many different types of trolley problems, [Lewis] Petrinovich found that the single most powerful more rule was '*Save people over animals*.'"

Chapter 3: Pet-O-Philia: Why Do Humans (And Only Humans) Love Pets?
---

72:  Referring to Keith Thomas: "pets are animals that are allowed in the house, given a name, and never eaten."

73:  Referring to James Serpell: "pets are animals we live with that have no obvious function."

78:  "The estimated lifetime cost of pet ownership is about $8,000 for a medium size dog and $10,000 for a cat (that's because cats live longer). But what kind of bang are you getting for your pet buck?"

79:  "The demography of pet-keeping also presents a problem for the unconditional love hypothesis. This view predicts that people living alone would have the most need for unconditional love and thus have the highest levels of pet ownership. This is not the case. In fact, adults living alone have the lowest rates of pet ownership, while adults raising school-aged kids have the highest. Interestingly, while adults with children have the highest rates of pet ownership, as a group, they are less attached to their animals than people who live alone with pets. In fact, pet attachment drops a notch with each additional person added to a family. Pets in homes with young children really get the shaft. For example, only about 25% of pets in families with children are groomed every day compared to nearly 80% of pets who reside with adults who do not have kids. Dogs and cats in childless homes are the ones most likely to be showered with Christmas presents and go on family vacations. Sadly, the dog that was 'our baby' during the first years of a couple's marriage is often demoted the moment their first child comes home from the hospital."

Chapter 4: Friends, Foes, and Fashion Statements: The Human-Dog Relationship
---

106:  "But if humans did not tame wolves, how did they become our pals? [Ray] Coppinger says they tamed themselves. He traces the emergence of dogs to the time people began to give up the nomadic life and settle into permanent villages. Settlements generate piles of refuse, potential gold mines for opportunistic scavengers. Wolves who were less nervous around humans would be more efficient garbage-pickers, just like the dogs-gone-wild you can see today hanging around garbage dumps on the outskirts of Lagos or Mexico City or Istanbul. These animals would have been better nourished than their warier competitors, hence bearing more offspring--puppies that would share their parents' genes for being less fearful of humans. Over generations, these tamer animals would have access to more food and eventually adapt to living around people. This self-domestication process would set the stage for unconscious selective breeding for functional traits like barking at strangers and chasing game."

121:  "Presently, Americans seem to be in the burnout phase of another canine fad--the desire to own a purebred dog."

125:  "In 1970, 23 million cats and dogs were euthanized in animal shelters in the United States. In 2007, the number had dropped to an estimated 4 million. This drastic reduction in the number of abandoned pets is the result of the most successful campaign in the history of the modern animal protection movement: the spay and neuter crusade."

126:  "Spay and neuter campaigns have been much more successful in the Northeast, the Midwest, and on the West Coast than in my [North Carolina] part of the country."

Chapter 5: 'Prom Queen Kills First Deer on Sixteenth Birthday': Gender and the Human-Animal Relationship
---

134:  "[Stephen Kellert] has consistently found that women are more concerned with protecting animals than men are. But, at the same time, phobias of creatures like snakes and spiders are three times more common in women than men. And while men know more about the biology and ecology of other species than women, they tend to appreciate animals for what Kellert calls 'practical and recreational reasons.' In other words, men are more likely to approve of killing animals for fun and profit."

135:  "But while men and women are fairly similar when it comes to *attitudes* about animal welfare, the sexes are not at all alike when it comes to *taking action* on behalf of other species."

135-6:  "The modern animal rights movement has recruited women in droves; every study of the sociology of animal liberation has found that three to four times as many women as men boycott circuses, march against animal experimentation, and drive cars plastered with 'Meat is Murder' bumper stickers."

138:  "There is one exception to the rule that most animal abusers are men. Three times as many women as men get caught up in animal hoarding."

Chapter 6: In the Eyes of the Beholder: The Comparative Cruelty of Cockfights and Happy Meals
---

150:  "And it dawned on me that the comparative ethics of fighting chickens versus eating them is more complicated than most people realize."

158:  "In recent years, the influx of immigrants has affected cockfighting just as it has many other aspect of American culture. […] Old-timers aren't keen on these new developments."

159:  "Most Appalachian cockfighters made no real effort to conceal their involvement in their sport, even though it was against the law."

160:  "Most people imagine that cockfighters are low-life scum who peddle crystal meth when they are not gleefully torturing animals. I found, however, that the most psychologically interesting thing about rooster fighters is how boringly normal they are. Nearly all the cockers I have known led--aside from their devotion to a brutal bloodsport--ordinary lives complete with mortgages, wives, children, and day jobs."

161:  "If cockfighters were sadistic perverts, it would be easy to explain their involvement in a cruel bloodsport. But given that most are not, how can they participate in an activity that is illegal and that nearly everyone in America thinks is immoral? The answer is that they construct a moral framework based on a mix of wishful thinking and logic in which cockfighting becomes completely acceptable. In this regard they are no different from any other person who exploits animals--hunters, circus animal trainers, even scientists and meat eaters."

166:  "This leads to an asymmetry of animosity--animal activists hate cockfighters more than cockfighters hate animal protectionists."

171:  "The war on cockfighting is about cruelty, but the subtext is social class."

Chapter 7: Delicious, Dangerous, Disgusting, and Dead: The Human-Meat Relationship
---

176:  "It is true that an increasing number of people believe that animals are entitled to basic rights, including, one presumes, the right not to be killed because you happen to be made out of meat."

181:  "meat is the most dangerous of the foods we eat."

186:  "Meat-dog puppies are harvested at six months of age when they are still tender."

189:  "[Paul] Rozin believes that people find many animal products, including their flesh, disgusting because animals are an uncomfortable reminder of our mortality."

190:  "Usually, shoppers are drawn to foods that appear fresh, juicy, and natural. But in the case of meat, fresh, juicy, and natural is seen as gross, particularly to women."

191:  "Ironically, the efforts by animal protectionists to improve the well-being of farm animals have made the consumption of flesh more, rather than less, morally palatable."

194: "most 'vegetarians' in the United States eat animal flesh."

196:  "Paul Rozin and his colleagues found moral-origin vegetarians are more disgusted by meat than health-origin vegetarians, and they are more upset at the prospect of chewing and swallowing it."

201:  Quoting Gary Steiner: "You just haven't lived until you've tried to function as a strict vegan in a meat-crazed society. What were once the most straightforward activities become a constant ordeal."

Chapter 8: The Moral Status of Mice: The Use of Animals in Science
---

207:  "vivisection--the nineteenth-century term for invasive animal research."

213:  "The movie made me realize that the justification for animal experimentation, including my own research, ultimately rests on the premise that organisms with bigger brains have the right to conduct research on creatures with less developed mental capacities."

213:  "I cannot see any way to set the moral bar so it is high enough to exclude all nonhuman animals, low enough to include all human beings, and be based on morally relevant traits--the ability to feel pain counts; having two legs does not."

223:  "more genetically modified mice are gassed each year in rodent production facilities than are actually used in experiments."

227:  "Our statistical analysis indicated that the committees might as well have made their decisions by flipping a coin."

227:  "The truth is that scientists have problems discerning the quality and importance of research."

234:  "I think the argument for animal research is stronger than that for any other human use of animals, including eating them." But, note, he still eats them.

Chapter 9: The Cats in Our Houses, The Cows on Our Plates
---

241:  "It turns out that three out of four animal rights activists are women, and most of them are politically liberal, well-educated, solidly middle class, and primarily white. Nearly all of them, of course, have pets. Animal activists come to their movement via different paths, but the most common thread is moral shock."

246:  "Adding to their psychological burden is the fact that animal activists are constantly bombarded with reminders of animal cruelty--the meat counter at the grocery store, the smell of grilled flesh when they walked past a Burger King, a woman wearing a fur coat at the airport, the continual barrage of fund-raising emails from animal protection organizations that flood their inbox"

Chapter 10: The Carnivorous Yahoo Within Ourselves: Dealing With Moral Inconsistency
---

266:  Quoting Michael Mountain of Best Friends: "I suppose my rule is much like the philosophy behind Best Friends. You can't save all the animals in the world, but the ones that come into your care, you are responsible for. So, once the fly enters my house, I have a responsibility to treat it with kindness."

279:  "What the new science of anthrozoology reveals is that our attitudes, behaviors, and relationships with the animals in our lives--the ones we love, the ones we hate, and the ones we eat--are, likewise, more complicated than we thought."

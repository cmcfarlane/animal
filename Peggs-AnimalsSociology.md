Chapter 1: Sociology and Animals
---

5:  "the focus is on *humans* in what are seen as *human* societies."

10:  "[Alger & Alger] give the example of 'instinct', which was constructed in over a third of the textbooks as being applicable to the behaviour of other animals but not to that of humans; humans are constructed as uniquely without instincts"

Chapter 2: Animals and Biology as Destiny
---

16: "Sociological theories that centre on action, which stress the role of meaning in social interaction, point us to the *social* rather than the *biological* foundations of sociological analysis."

17:  "An essential difference between humans and other animals is established in the perception that humans, unlike other animals, have transcended their biology; it is precisely this transcendence that is said to define the human as human."

23:  "Consequently, when biological determinism is applied to humans it is usually accepted by sociobiology but is contentious and is often refuted by sociology. However, when biological determinism is applied to other animals it is usually seen as non contentious by sociology, sociobiology and many other disciplines."

Chapter 3: Animals, Social Inequalities and Oppression
---

37:  "Like racism, sexism and classism (to give three examples), speciesism has social structural and economic causes, it is institutionally based, it supports oppressive social arrangements and it 'legitimates and inspires prejudice and discrimination.'"

	Citing: Nibert, D. *Animal Rights/Human Rights: Entanglement of Opression and Liberation*. Rowman & Littlefield, 2002 at 10, 17.
	
37:  Nibert identifies three factors legitimating speciesism: economic exploitation/competition, unequal power (especially state) and ideological control. (Citing 2002 at 13).

40:  "Ideologies are beliefs that legitimate powerful interests and thus justify the subordination of one group by another and, as such, ideologies that devalue a whole group (such as racism, sexism, classism and speciesism) are socially constructed."

43:  "A social constructionist critique suggests that our notions of 'animal' and 'human' are purely ideas, not truths; they are ideas that are constructed within discourses and are maintained through the use of discourses."

Chapter 4: Animals, Crime and Abuse
---

52:  "The change in the legal position of other animals is an indicator of changing ideas about the moral worth of other animals and notions of whether other animals have rights."

55:  "Much discussion about the abuse of other animals centres on the links between such abuse and the abuse of humans, and this has become an important area of sociological research. Crucially, much less attention has been given to the other animals as the one who is wronged"

59:  "Consequently academic research could examine why the deaths of billions of other animals that occur in the food and clothing industry and that result from sport, leisure and recreational pursuits do not violate anticruelty statutes."

Chapter 5: Town and Country: Animals, Space and Place
---

72:  "humans have notions about the proper places that other animals should occupy; however, there is no consensus among humans about how this should play out in practice."

75:  "[Digard] centres on the process of domesticatory action that is exerted by humans on other animals in specific contexts and spaces, rather than on specified other animals as being in a state of 'domestication.'"

77:  "a profusion of other animals [pets] who were not eaten by humans, who were given personal names and who had co-residency with humans."

78:  "Unlike 'pets' who might be thought to be happy with the lot, 'good animals' who are treated as tools are not necessarily happy about the way in which they are treated as their position is based purely on their utility to humans."

81:  "The rat in a laboratory is a suffering device who is viewed as a 'good animal' because she or he acts as a valuable tool for humans"

82:  "Other animals who humans see as vermin rarely physically threaten humans, yet they invoke feelings of disgust as they are often seen as symbols of dirt."

83:  "pit bulls seem to be so demonized that they are seen as not fit to live at all."

Chapter 6: Consumption of the Animal
---

90:  "Consumer societies are based in gross materialism, an approach to consuming that centres on the satisfying of our needs rather than on the ethics associated with what and how we consume."

95:  "On average each cow produced 5314 pounds of milk in 1950 compared with 18,204 in 2000. In order to produce this amount of milk cows must give birth every 12 or 14 months and each cow must produce around 14 liters of milk a day."

95:  Piglets are weaned at the very young age of three weeks, and within five or six days of being weaned their mother is subjected to forced insemination so that she can give birth to the next set of offspring."

98:  "in the richer nations, it seems that the consumption of 'meat' has been transformed from being a high-status healthy practice to a practice associated with poor health and lower income groups."

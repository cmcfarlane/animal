Chapter 1: Sociology and Animals
---

5:  "the focus is on *humans* in what are seen as *human* societies."

10:  "[Alger & Alger] give the example of 'instinct', which was constructed in over a third of the textbooks as being applicable to the behaviour of other animals but not to that of humans; humans are constructed as uniquely without instincts"

Chapter 2: Animals and Biology as Destiny
---

16: "Sociological theories that centre on action, which stress the role of meaning in social interaction, point us to the *social* rather than the *biological* foundations of sociological analysis."

17:  "An essential difference between humans and other animals is established in the perception that humans, unlike other animals, have transcended their biology; it is precisely this transcendence that is said to define the human as human."

23:  "Consequently, when biological determinism is applied to humans it is usually accepted by sociobiology but is contentious and is often refuted by sociology. However, when biological determinism is applied to other animals it is usually seen as non contentious by sociology, sociobiology and many other disciplines."

Chapter 3: Animals, Social Inequalities and Oppression
---

37:  "Like racism, sexism and classism (to give three examples), speciesism has social structural and economic causes, it is institutionally based, it supports oppressive social arrangements and it 'legitimates and inspires prejudice and discrimination.'"

37:  Nibert identifies three factors legitimating speciesism: economic exploitation/competition, unequal power (especially state) and ideological control. (Citing 2002 at 13).

40:  "Ideologies are beliefs that legitimate powerful interests and thus justify the subordination of one group by another and, as such, ideologies that devalue a whole group (such as racism, sexism, classism and speciesism) are socially constructed."

43:  "A social constructionist critique suggests that our notions of 'animal' and 'human' are purely ideas, not truths; they are ideas that are constructed within discourses and are maintained through the use of discourses."

Chapter 4: Animals, Crime and Abuse
---

52:  "The change in the legal position of other animals is an indicator of changing ideas about the moral worth of other animals and notions of whether other animals have rights."

55:  "Much discussion about the abuse of other animals centres on the links between such abuse and the abuse of humans, and this has become an important area of sociological research. Crucially, much less attention has been given to the other animals as the one who is wronged"

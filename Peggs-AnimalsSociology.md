5:  "the focus is on *humans* in what are seen as *human* societies."

Chapter 2: Animals and Biology as Destiny

16: "Sociological theories that centre on action, which stress the role of meaning in social interaction, point us to the *social* rather than the *biological* foundations of sociological analysis."

17:  "An essential difference between humans and other animals is established in the perception that humans, unlike other animals, have transcended their biology; it is precisely this transcendence that is said to define the human as human."

23:  "Consequently, when biological determinism is applied to humans it is usually accepted by sociobiology but is contentious and is often refuted by sociology. However, when biological determinism is applied to other animals it is usually seen as non contentious by sociology, sociobiology and many other disciplines."

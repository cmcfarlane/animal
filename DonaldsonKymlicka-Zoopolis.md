Chapter 1: Introduction

3:  "But what is surely clear, after 180 years of organized animal advocacy, is that we have made no demonstrable progress towards dismantling the system of animal exploitation."

3:  "this failure is a predictable result of the flawed terms in which animal issues are publicly debated."

3:  "such change will only be possible if we can develop a new moral framework, one that connects the treatment of animals more directly to fundamental principles of liberal-democratic justice and human rights."

4:  "animals, like humans, should be seen as possessing certain *inviolable rights*: there are some things that should not be done to animals even in pursuit of human interests or ecosystems vitality."

4:  "we must also acknowledge that, to date at least, this approach remains politically marginalized."

4-5:  "But it has virtually no resonance amongst the general public."

5:  "The animal rights framework remains, for all intents and purposes, a political non-starter."

6:  "ART has said little about what *positive* obligations we may owe to animals---such as an obligation to respect animals' habitat, or obligations to design our buildings, roads, and neighbourhoods in a way that takes into account animals' needs, or obligations to rescue animals who are unintentionally harmed by human activities, or obligations to care for those animals who have become dependent upon us."

6:  "ART has had little to say about our *relational* duties---that is, duties arising not just from the intrinsic characteristics of animals (such as their consciousness), but from the more geographically and historically specific relationships that have developed between particular groups of humans and particular groups of animals."

8:  "the traditional ART view ignores the dense patterns of interaction that inevitably link humans and animals."

8:  "We are part of a shared society with innumerable animals, one which would continue to exist even if we eliminated cases of 'forced participation.'"

9:  "In our view, limiting ART to a set of negative rights is not only unsustainable intellectually, it is also damaging politically, since it deprives ART of a positive conception of human-animal interaction."

10:  "If ART is to gain political traction, we need to show that prohibiting exploitative relationships with animals does not entail cutting ourselves off from meaningful forms of human--animal interaction."

11:  "In short, if ART's conception of basic individual rights is interpreted narrowly, it provides no protection against degradation of the environment; but i f its conception of basic rights is interpreted expansively, it seems to licence massive human intervention in nature."

12:  "There are certain 'invariant' ethical prescriptions---certain universal negative rights owed to all beings with a subjective experience of the world---and there are also variable ethical prescriptions based on the nature of our relationships."

12:  "we hope to shift the debate about animals from an issue in applied ethics to a question of political theory."

14:  "Some animals should be seen as forming separate sovereign communities on their own territories (animals in the wild vulnerable to human invasion and colonization); some animals are akin to migrants or denizens who choose to move into areas of human habitation (liminal opportunistic animals); and some animals should be seen as full citizens of the polity because of they way they've been bred over generations for interdependence with humans (domesticated animals)."

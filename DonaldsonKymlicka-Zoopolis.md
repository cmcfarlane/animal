Chapter 1: Introduction
---

3:  "But what is surely clear, after 180 years of organized animal advocacy, is that we have made no demonstrable progress towards dismantling the system of animal exploitation."

3:  "this failure is a predictable result of the flawed terms in which animal issues are publicly debated."

3:  "such change will only be possible if we can develop a new moral framework, one that connects the treatment of animals more directly to fundamental principles of liberal-democratic justice and human rights."

4:  "animals, like humans, should be seen as possessing certain *inviolable rights*: there are some things that should not be done to animals even in pursuit of human interests or ecosystems vitality."

4:  "we must also acknowledge that, to date at least, this approach remains politically marginalized."

4-5:  "But it has virtually no resonance amongst the general public."

5:  "The animal rights framework remains, for all intents and purposes, a political non-starter."

6:  "ART has said little about what *positive* obligations we may owe to animals---such as an obligation to respect animals' habitat, or obligations to design our buildings, roads, and neighbourhoods in a way that takes into account animals' needs, or obligations to rescue animals who are unintentionally harmed by human activities, or obligations to care for those animals who have become dependent upon us."

6:  "ART has had little to say about our *relational* duties---that is, duties arising not just from the intrinsic characteristics of animals (such as their consciousness), but from the more geographically and historically specific relationships that have developed between particular groups of humans and particular groups of animals."

8:  "the traditional ART view ignores the dense patterns of interaction that inevitably link humans and animals."

8:  "We are part of a shared society with innumerable animals, one which would continue to exist even if we eliminated cases of 'forced participation.'"

9:  "In our view, limiting ART to a set of negative rights is not only unsustainable intellectually, it is also damaging politically, since it deprives ART of a positive conception of human-animal interaction."

10:  "If ART is to gain political traction, we need to show that prohibiting exploitative relationships with animals does not entail cutting ourselves off from meaningful forms of human--animal interaction."

11:  "In short, if ART's conception of basic individual rights is interpreted narrowly, it provides no protection against degradation of the environment; but i f its conception of basic rights is interpreted expansively, it seems to licence massive human intervention in nature."

12:  "There are certain 'invariant' ethical prescriptions---certain universal negative rights owed to all beings with a subjective experience of the world---and there are also variable ethical prescriptions based on the nature of our relationships."

12:  "we hope to shift the debate about animals from an issue in applied ethics to a question of political theory."

14:  "Some animals should be seen as forming separate sovereign communities on their own territories (animals in the wild vulnerable to human invasion and colonization); some animals are akin to migrants or denizens who choose to move into areas of human habitation (liminal opportunistic animals); and some animals should be seen as full citizens of the polity because of they way they've been bred over generations for interdependence with humans (domesticated animals)."

Chapter 2: Universal Basic Rights for Animals
---

19:  "all animals with subjective existence---that is, all animals who are conscious or sentient beings---should be viewed as the subjects of justice, and as the bearers of inviolable rights."

19:  "The idea of inviolable rights implies than an individual's most basic interests cannot be sacrificed for the greater good of others."

20:  "usually understood in terms of a set of basic negative rights against fundamental harms such as killing, slavery, torture, or confinement."

20:  "the idea that humans possess inviolable rights is widely accepted, despite ongoing philosophical debate regarding the grounding for human rights."

21:  Referring to Cavalieri: "it's time to take the human out of human rights."

22:  For utilitarians "We are all 'freely violable in the service of the greater good', and so you have to earn your right to life by showing that your continued existence serves the overall good."

22:  "The principle of inviolability says that people's right to life is independent of their relative contribution to the overall good, and is not violable in the service of the greater good."

23:  "The issue of inviolability is, to repeat, the question of whether one's basic interests can or cannot be sacrificed for the greater good of others. The human rights revolution says that human beings possess such inviolability. The strong AR position says that sentient animals also possess such inviolability. Some readers may worry that extending inviolability to animals 'cheapens' the hard-won achievements of the rights revolution. We argue, on the contrary, that any attempt to restrict inviolability to human beings can only be done by radically weakening and destabilizing the scheme of human rights protection, leaving many humans as well as animals outside the scope of effective protection."

24:  "Conscious/sentient beings are selves---that is, they have a distinctive subjective experience of their own lives and of the world, which demands a specific kind of protection in the form of inviolable rights."

25:  "Since existing human rights norms are often phrased as 'all persons have the right to x', we can restate the ART position as saying that because animals have selfhood, they too should be included in the category of persons."

26:  "Any attempt to draw a line between selves and persons will cut across the species line, treating some humans and some animals as persons, while relegating other humans and other animals to the status of 'mere' selves."

26:  "There is simply no plausible moral justification for ascribing inviolable rights based on personhood rather than selfhood."

27:  Referring to Kantian autonomy=personhood: "And yet are children and the cognitively impaired not persons? Are they not precisely the most vulnerable kinds of human beings whom the concept of inviolable human rights ought to protect?"

30:  "Rather, we believe that respecting inviolability is, first and foremost, a process of intersubjective recognition---that is, the first question is simply whether there is a 'subject' there, whether there is 'someone home'. This process of intersubjective recognition precedes any attempt to enumerate his or her capacities or interests. Once we know there is someone home, we know we are dealing with a vulnerable self, a being with subjective experience whose life can go better or worse as experienced from the inside. And so we know we should respect their inviolable rights, even before we know their variable capacities such as intelligence or moral agency."

31:  Problems with identifying selfhood easily resolved in practice: "Indeed, the types of animals that are most cruelly abused are precisely those whose consciousness is least in doubt."

32:  "This is where the science of other minds becomes crucial---not in determining *who* has basic rights, but in helping us to understand *how* best to interact with them."

33:  "Indeed, some ecologists argue that ART remains fundamentally an anthropocentric theory: it takes human beings as the measure of moral status, and simply argues that some other species share enough human-like characteristics to qualify for human rights."

33:  "This is not imposing a human-centric moral criterion on animals---on the contrary, what happens to sentient beings matters because it matters *t0 them*."

34:  "A watershed can be harmed, and an otter can be harmed, but only the otter has the subjective experience of being harmed."

36:  "What explains the puzzling resistance of so many people---both humanists and ecologists---to acknowledging the selfhood of animals?"

40:  "What are the implications of recognizing animals as persons or selves with inviolable rights? In the simplest terms, it means recognizing that they are not means to our ends. They were not put on earth to serve us, or feed us, or comfort us. Rather, they have their own subjective existence, and hence their own equal and inviolable rights to life and liberty, which prohibits harming them, killing them, confining them, owning them, and enslaving them. Respect for these rights rules out virtually all existing practices of the animal-use industries, where animals are owned and exploited for human profit, pleasure, education, convenience, or comfort."

41:  "Ought implies can: humans only owe justice to each other when they are in fact able to respect each other's rights without jeopardizing their own existence."

42:  "What does not change, however, is our obligation to try to sustain the circumstances of justice where they exist, and to move towards the circumstances of justice where they do not yet exist."

43:  "Medical experimentation on animals is often viewed as a hard case for animal rights. Even those who abhor factory farming, cosmetic testing, or recreational hunting will often condone medical research, as though giving up our access to unlimited, if imperfect, research subjects is too great a sacrifice to contemplate. But to view this as a sacrifice is already to misunderstand the moral situation."

49:  "Accepting that animals are selves or persons will have many implications, the clearest of which is to recognize a range of universal negative rights---the right not to be tortured, experimented on, owned, enslaved, imprisoned, or killed. This would entail the prohibition of current practices on farming, hunting, the commercial pet industry, zoo-keeping, animal experimentation, and many others."

49:  "Once we recognize the basic rights of animals, we need to ask about the appropriate forms of anima-human interaction that respect those rights."

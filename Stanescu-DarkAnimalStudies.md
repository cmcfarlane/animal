27:  "This animal studies is called 'dark' because its mode is connected with the aesthetic of noir fiction, Victorian Gothic, and the opacity and strangeness of the other. As such, dark animal studies privileges the monstrous over the natural, the contingent over the essential, and transgression over purity."

29:  "In all of these cases, the vampires control their appetites, often barely, in order to mark themselves as pure and moral."

29-30:  "The vegetarian vampire is never satisfied with her vegetarianism. Rather, this vegetarianism is seen as denial of her true nature."

30:  "In this case the word 'vegetarianism' has obviously no real meaning, except for one--to demarcate that the present vampire is 'good'."

30:  "The Victorian Gothic vampire has no reflection, but all these vegetarian vampires able to do is reflect upon their lives."

31:  "the vegetarian vampire is libidinally invested in the purity of her soul. This reflective, guilt-ridden obsession with purity underlies what Hegel has called the beautiful soul."

30:  "The beautiful soul, for Hegel, was a being who resists the entanglement of her own existence with external reality."

35:  "Many vegans, rather than feeling a sense of innocence, are racked by guilt."

35:  "We feel guilty by the actions we engaged in before we were vegans, we feel guilty by the inability of veganism to stop all cruelty towards animals, we feel guilty that we haven't convinced more people to be vegans, and on and on."

36:  "Becoming-vegan is not an end, but a process, an always ongoing process."

38:  "Becoming-vegan is not just an ontological practice, but an ethical practice at the same time."

38:  "The ethical comes to concern itself with a change in being."

38:  "This idea of becoming-vegan as a practice that transforms the self and our relationship with others, that allows us access to truths about how to relate to the other, is different from the usual justifications for veganism."

39:  "we can see that veganism as an economic boycott is a weak veganism."

39:  "Becoming-vegan is a recognition that veganism is always an on-going process, that we can never attain a pure state of being the vegan, but must always turn our practices to the concrete situations and material relations in front of us."

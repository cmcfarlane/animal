Introduction: Animality and Advocacy (Michael Lundblad and Marianne DeKoven)
---

1:  "why has there been resistance in the academy to linking advocacy for animals with advocacy for various human groups?"

5:  "the implication that speciesism is more foundational or more problematic than other '-isms' might explain some of the resistance to animal studies, particularly from scholars committed to other forms of human advocacy."

6:  "animal studies remains a broad field with no mandatory form of advocacy and no necessary correlation with animal rights activism, in particular."

11:  "humans can be seen as distinct form other animals in their capacity to act *inhumanely*."

18:  "This is what I mean by 'companion species'--those variously enduring quasi-stabilised, co-constituted entities whose very being is forged in the contact zones of the fleshy practices of eating together, of consortia at table, of breaking bread in all the joy and terror of getting on together on terra, that sf space that is also earthly critters' only place."e

Chapter 2: Humane Advocacy and the Humanities: The Very Idea (Cary Wolfe)

27-8:  "As I have often recalled from my years of experience as an animal rights activist, the language and rhetorical toolbox that one uses to lobby for humane advocacy when speaking to the local newspaper or television station is very different--and often, in fundamental ways, opposed--to the language one would use to address a conference full of, let's say, specialists in contemporary continental philosophy. In the former instance, my experience suggests, the discourse of universal rights, drawn from the liberal justice tradition in philosophy and from a very historically specific set of philosophical, political, and legal coordinates, isn't just handy but is in many ways as indispensable as it is unavoidable (the coin of the realm, as it were, when raising in our society issues of ethical standing and the legal safeguards needed to protect it). But in the latter instance--speaking to a roomful of people who cut their teeth on Lacan, Foucault, Lyotard, and others of that ilk--suggesting that the rights framework is a satisfactory way (much less the last word) for thinking about the complexities of subjectivity and ethics and how those might be retooled to include non-human beings will mark you as a backsliding humanist who skipped too much class when intellectual history from 1950 onwards was being taught."

50:  "Why cannot progressive intellectuals and groups interested in changing the world incorporate the goal of animal enfranchisement?"

50-1:  "Humanism, as I shall show, does not merely foster an attitude of carelessness toward the need for moral and legal extensionism concerning animals; it actually polices the species boundary whenever any extensionist demand is openly advanced."

51:  "refers to the view that equal moral respect is owed to all and only human beings."

58:  "The structure of the absent referent is enacted when the treatment of some beings is appropriated as a metaphor for the treatment of other beings. Within such a structure, animals are first made absent and then reinstated as metaphors for describing experiences of human beings."

58:  "In fact, all the intellectual history of the women's movement is marked by the dissociation from nonhumans."

59:  "apart from some voices in the ecofeminist area, what prevails in feminst theory is a negative attitude towards nonhumans and their status."

Chapter 4: Archaeology of a Humane Society: Animality, Savagery, Blackness (Michael Lundblad)

77:  "Humane reform actually became a new and flexible discourse for claiming superiority over various human 'races,' reinforcing the logic that only the more 'civilized' group had evolved enough to treat other groups 'humanely.'"

79-80:  "In the first three years after the founding of the ASPCA in 1866, for example, only a half-dozen or so state SPCAs were incorporated. Bu by December 1907, there were 246 societies nationwide, including some organizations advocating for children as well, while the American Humane Association claimed that 542 associations had been formed."

80:  "Most of this work was directed toward abuses of workhorses in urban areas, cruelty and neglect toward domestic pets, and practices of fighting or baiting animals such as cocks and dogs. Exceptions included the 'carnivorous appetite, the extension of science, the providing of exercise for an idle class;' thus meat eating, vivisection, and sport hunting, at least for many of the SPCAs, were seen as 'weighty enough to justify exceptions in the law of the land.'"

	Citing Roswell C. McCrae, *The Humane Movement*, 1910/1969.

87:  "the capacity for *either* humane or inhumane behavior is seen as a sign of difference from those savage groups that have not yet evolved this capacity."
